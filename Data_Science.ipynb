Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, Frankfurt am Main, 5 July 2001\\n\\nWith a transcript of the questions and answers \\n\\nLadies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by Mr. Reynders, President of the EU Council, and Mr. Solbes from the European Commission. \\n\\nAs usual, we conducted our \\nregular examination of monetary and economic developments\\n and analysed their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. The Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. It considers that the current monetary policy stance remains appropriate and should bring inflation back in line with price stability in the medium term. Maintaining a favourable perspective for price stability is the best contribution monetary policy can make to fostering economic growth over the long run. \\n\\nLet me elaborate somewhat on our assessment of the information provided under the two pillars of the ECB's monetary policy strategy. \\n\\nRegarding the first pillar, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 (adjusted for non-residents' holdings of money market fund shares/units) stood at 4.9% in the period from March to May 2001. As indicated previously, there is some evidence that M3 is currently distorted upwards by holdings of money market paper and short-term debt securities of non-euro area residents. Taking this into account, the three-month moving average of M3 in the period from March to May 2001 was broadly in line with the reference value of 4 1/2%. In addition, over recent months, the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector in the euro area has continued to moderate. \\n\\nConcerning the second pillar, given the circumstances, it seems particularly important to recall the forward-looking nature of our assessment. At the current juncture economic developments appear to be particularly influenced by special factors. HICP inflation is still high at present, mainly reflecting past trends in energy and food prices. However, given the nature of these shocks and taking into account the present monetary policy stance, we expect them to have only a temporary effect on inflation rates. If no further unfavourable shocks occur, it is likely that annual rates of inflation will start to fall and reach rates of below 2% in 2002 - although the decrease from current levels over the months to come may be subject to some volatility. The main risk related to this outlook concerns second-round effects having an impact on wage negotiations this year and early next. As has been said on previous occasions, when looking back, the wage developments seen so far have been satisfactory, while, when looking to the future, there is ongoing concern. \\n\\nAs has now been confirmed, overall economic growth in the euro area moderated substantially in early 2001 and both survey and confidence indicators suggest a pattern of continued growth moderation for the second quarter of the year. These developments appear to be related to the less favourable external environment as well as to the weak growth of domestic demand. The latter reflects the adverse effects on income and consumption from past increases in energy and food prices and the slowdown in investment. However, in the course of the year, domestic demand should gradually recover from adverse price effects, given the sound economic fundamentals of the euro area, previous and ongoing tax reforms and favourable financing conditions. Average real GDP growth in the euro area is therefore expected to remain broadly in line with trend potential growth in 2001 and 2002. \\n\\nOverall, our current policy stance should ensure price stability in the medium term. Of course, we shall continue to monitor closely future developments affecting the balance of risks to price stability, including - in particular - monetary developments, real GDP growth, price-setting behaviour and wage developments. \\n\\nAs I said earlier, at a point in time when economic developments are being affected by a number of special factors, the Governing Council would like to stress its medium-term and forward-looking perspective. Monetary policy will ensure a stance consistent with price stability over the medium term. Keeping firmly to this commitment has favourable effects on the economy as a whole. Since the start of Monetary Union, monetary policy has been successful in maintaining low inflationary expectations over the medium term. As a consequence, the euro area enjoys low long-term interest rates which are conducive to both economic growth and employment creation. A factor facilitating the maintenance of price stability will be continued wage moderation. Such moderation will help employment growth and thereby foster consumer confidence and domestic demand in the period ahead. \\n\\nIn addition, the prospects for non-inflationary economic growth can be significantly enhanced by decisive structural reform. Delays in introducing such reforms on the basis of cyclical considerations would be at the expense of medium-term growth opportunities. \\n\\nA medium-term perspective is also most warranted for the conduct of fiscal policies in the euro area member countries. For all euro area countries, it is of crucial importance to fulfil in a credible manner the commitments made under the Stability and Growth Pact and those laid down in the context of the stability programmes. \\n\\nLet me now give the floor to the Vice-President, who will inform you about some other issues. \\n\\nLet me first refer to the current discussion on the potential impact on prices of the euro cash changeover. In general, price transparency and market competition are likely to limit inflationary pressures from the cash changeover. As regards administered prices, the finance ministers forming the Eurogroup have pledged that \\\"overall, the conversion into euro of all prices, charges and fees administered by their governments will be price neutral or smoothed in favour of the consumer\\\". The Governing Council calls on governments at other levels and enterprises to follow this example set by central governments. Moreover, the ECB calls upon the public's vigilance in monitoring prices and price changes, encouraging consumer and other organisations to actively engage in this task. \\n\\nSecond, I should like to inform you that the Governing Council has decided that euro area national central banks may \\nfrontload euro banknotes to central banks outside the euro area\\n as from 1 December 2001. This measure is aimed at contributing to a smooth cash changeover in 2002. You will find further information relating to this decision in a separate \\npress release\\n to be issued this afternoon. \\n\\nThird, as you are aware, the Governing Council paid particular attention to the specific needs of the blind and partially sighted when agreeing on the design of euro banknotes. To that end, several features have been incorporated into both the banknotes and the coins. In order to further assist visually handicapped citizens in recognising the euro banknotes and coins, and to help them to distinguish between the various denominations, the Governing Council decided to allocate about EUR 1 million to the production of 400,000 specially designed \\ncash-testing devices.\\n These will be made available via the network of the European Blind Union. \\n\\nFinally, the Governing Council has adopted a Decision amending the Decision on the adoption of \\nthe Conditions of Employment for Staff of the European Central Bank. \\nThis Decision will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. \\n\\nWe are now at your disposal for questions.\",\n          \"Introductory statement to the press conference (with Q&A)\\n\\nMario Draghi, President of the ECB,V\\u00edtor Const\\u00e2ncio, Vice-President of the ECB,Frankfurt am Main, 7 February 2013\\n\\n\\nLadies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today\\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council.\\n\\nBased on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the \\nkey ECB interest rates\\n unchanged. HICP inflation rates have declined further, as anticipated, and are expected to fall below 2% in the coming months. Over the policy-relevant horizon, inflationary pressures should remain contained. The underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. Medium to longer-term inflation expectations for the euro area remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. Overall, this allows our monetary policy stance to remain accommodative. The economic weakness in the euro area is expected to prevail in the early part of 2013. In particular, necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors will continue to weigh on economic activity. Later in 2013 economic activity should gradually recover, supported by our accommodative monetary policy stance, the improvement in financial market confidence and reduced fragmentation, as well as a strengthening of global demand. In order to sustain confidence, it is essential for governments to reduce further both fiscal and structural imbalances and to proceed with financial sector restructuring. \\n\\nWith regard to the liquidity situation of banks, counterparties have so far repaid \\u20ac140.6 billion of the \\u20ac489.2 billion obtained in the first of the two three-year longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) settled in December 2011 and March 2012. This reflects the improvement in financial market confidence. Repayments are provided for in the modalities of the three-year LTROs and are at the discretion of the counterparties, who must appropriately assess their funding situation, their ability to provide new loans to the economy and their resilience to shocks. We will closely monitor conditions in the money market and their potential impact on the stance of monetary policy, which will remain accommodative with the full allotment mode of liquidity provision.\\n\\nLet me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the \\neconomic analysis\\n. Euro area real GDP declined by 0.1%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2012, following a contraction of 0.2% in the second quarter. Available data continue to signal further weakness in activity in the fourth quarter and at the beginning of 2013. This weakness reflects the adverse impact of low consumer and investor sentiment on domestic expenditure, as well as subdued foreign demand. However, financial market sentiment has improved and the latest survey indicators confirm earlier evidence of a stabilisation in business and consumer confidence, albeit at low levels. Later in 2013 a gradual recovery should start, with domestic demand being supported by our accommodative monetary policy stance, the improvement in financial market confidence and reduced fragmentation, and export growth benefiting from a strengthening of global demand. \\n\\nThe risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. They relate to the possibility of weaker than expected domestic demand and exports, slow implementation of structural reforms in the euro area, as well as geopolitical issues and imbalances in major industrialised countries which could both have an impact on developments in global commodities and financial markets. These factors have the potential to dampen the ongoing improvement in confidence and thereby delay the recovery. \\n\\nAccording to Eurostat\\u2019s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.0% in January 2013, down from 2.2% in November and December and from 2.5% in October. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates are expected to decline further to below 2% in the coming months. Over the policy-relevant horizon, in an environment of weak economic activity in the euro area and well-anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain contained. \\n\\nRisks to the outlook for price developments continue to be seen as broadly balanced over the medium term, with upside risks relating to higher administered prices and indirect taxes, as well as higher oil prices, and downside risks stemming from weaker economic activity and, more recently, the appreciation of the euro exchange rate. \\n\\nTurning to the \\nmonetary analysis\\n, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. The annual growth rate of M3 decreased to 3.3% in December 2012, from 3.8% in November. Shifts from overnight deposits to short-term time deposits led to a decrease in the annual rate of growth of M1, which declined to 6.2% in December, from 6.7% in November, and outflows from marketable instruments dampened overall M3 growth. A further strengthening in the deposit base of MFIs in a number of stressed countries took place in December, in combination with further capital inflows into the euro area, both of which continued to reduce fragmentation. \\n\\nThe annual growth rate of loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained negative in December. This mainly reflected ongoing negative annual growth of loans to non-financial corporations, which was -1.3% in December after -1.5% in November. However, annual growth in MFI loans to households remained broadly unchanged at 0.7% in December. To a large extent, subdued loan dynamics reflect the current stage of the business cycle, heightened credit risk and the ongoing adjustment in the balance sheets of the financial and non-financial sectors. In line with these developments, the bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2012 confirms the weakness in credit demand and the continued effect of credit risk considerations on the tightening of credit standards. At the same time, the survey confirms the positive impact of Eurosystem measures on banks\\u2019 overall funding and liquidity situation. In particular, banks reported improvements across all funding categories in the fourth quarter. \\n\\nIn order to ensure adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential to continue strengthening the resilience of banks where needed. Decisive steps for establishing an integrated financial framework will help to accomplish this objective. The future single supervisory mechanism (SSM) is one of the main building blocks. It is a crucial move towards re-integrating the banking system.\\n\\nTo sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. A \\ncross-check\\n with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture.\\n\\nAs regards other policy areas, \\nstructural reforms\\n and \\nfiscal adjustment\\n can complement each other, thereby improving the outlook for job creation, economic growth and debt sustainability. Past policy action is bearing fruit, in terms of both the unwinding of existing fiscal imbalances and the reduction of current account deficits. In particular, in several countries with particular adjustment needs, contained growth in unit labour costs signals greater price competitiveness and exports are performing better. Governments should build on the progress achieved in fiscal consolidation, strengthen competition in product markets and continue with labour market reforms. This would boost the euro area\\u2019s growth potential, reduce high structural unemployment and improve the adjustment capacities of the euro area countries. \\n\\nWe are now at your disposal for questions.\",\n          \"Introductory statement to the press conference (with Q&A)\\n\\nMario Draghi, President of the ECB, V\\u00edtor Const\\u00e2ncio, Vice-President of the ECB,Frankfurt am Main, 3 December 2015\\n\\n\\nLadies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today\\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President, Mr\\u00a0Dombrovskis.\\n\\nBased on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we today conducted a thorough assessment of the strength and persistence of the factors that are currently slowing the return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term and re-examined the degree of monetary accommodation. As a result, the Governing Council took the following decisions in the pursuit of its price stability objective: \\n\\nFirst, as regards the \\nkey ECB interest rates\\n, we decided to lower the interest rate on the deposit facility by 10 basis points to -0.30%. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the rate on the marginal lending facility will remain unchanged at their current levels of 0.05% and 0.30% respectively. \\n\\nSecond, as regards \\nnon-standard monetary policy measures\\n, we decided to extend the asset purchase programme (APP). The monthly purchases of \\u20ac60 billion under the APP are now intended to run until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.\\n\\nThird, we decided to \\nreinvest the principal payments\\n on the securities purchased under the APP as they mature, for as long as necessary. This will contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance. The technical details will be communicated in due time.\\n\\nFourth, we decided to include, in the public sector purchase programme, \\neuro-denominated marketable debt instruments issued by regional and local governments located in the euro area\\n in the list of assets that are eligible for regular purchases by the respective national central banks. \\n\\nFifth, we decided to continue conducting the main refinancing operations and three-month longer-term refinancing operations as \\nfixed rate tender procedures with full allotment\\n for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the last reserve maintenance period of 2017. \\n\\nToday\\u2019s decisions were taken in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% and thereby to anchor medium-term inflation expectations. The latest staff projections incorporate the favourable financial market developments following our last monetary policy meeting. They still indicate continued downside risks to the inflation outlook and slightly weaker inflation dynamics than previously expected. This follows downward revisions in earlier projection exercises. The persistence of low inflation rates reflects sizeable economic slack weighing on domestic price pressures and headwinds from the external environment. \\n\\nOur new measures will ensure accommodative financial conditions and further strengthen the substantial easing impact of the measures taken since June 2014, which have had significant positive effects on financing conditions, credit and the real economy. Today\\u2019s decisions also reinforce the momentum of the euro area\\u2019s economic recovery and strengthen its resilience against recent global economic shocks. The Governing Council will closely monitor the evolution in the outlook for price stability and, if warranted, is willing and able to act by using all the instruments available within its mandate in order to maintain an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation. In particular, the Governing Council recalls that the APP provides sufficient flexibility in terms of adjusting its size, composition and duration. \\n\\nLet me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the \\neconomic analysis\\n. Euro area real GDP increased by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2015, following a rise of 0.4% in the previous quarter, most likely on account of a continued positive contribution from consumption alongside more muted developments in investment and exports. The most recent survey indicators point to ongoing real GDP growth in the final quarter of the year. Looking ahead, we expect the economic recovery to proceed. Domestic demand should be further supported by our monetary policy measures and their favourable impact on financial conditions, as well as by the earlier progress made with fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. Moreover, low oil prices should provide support for households\\u2019 real disposable income and corporate profitability and, therefore, private consumption and investment. In addition, government expenditure is likely to increase in some parts of the euro area, reflecting measures in support of refugees. However, the economic recovery in the euro area continues to be dampened by subdued growth prospects in emerging markets and moderate global trade, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms.\\n\\nThis outlook is broadly reflected in the December 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.5% in 2015, 1.7% in 2016 and 1.9% in 2017. Compared with the September 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the prospects for real GDP growth are broadly unchanged.\\n\\nThe risks to the euro area growth outlook relate in particular to the heightened uncertainties regarding developments in the global economy as well as to broader geopolitical risks. These risks have the potential to weigh on global growth and foreign demand for euro area exports and on confidence more widely. \\n\\nAccording to Eurostat\\u2019s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 0.1% in November 2015, unchanged from October but lower than expected. This reflected somewhat weaker price increases in services and industrial goods, mainly compensated for by a less negative contribution from energy prices. On the basis of the information available and current oil futures prices, annual HICP inflation rates are expected to rise at the turn of the year, mainly on account of base effects associated with the fall in oil prices in late 2014. During 2016 and 2017, inflation rates are foreseen to pick up further, supported by our previous monetary policy measures \\u2013 and supplemented by those announced today \\u2013 the expected economic recovery, and the pass-through of past declines in the euro exchange rate. The Governing Council will closely monitor the evolution of inflation rates over the period ahead. \\n\\nThis broad pattern is also reflected in the December 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 0.1% in 2015, 1.0% in 2016 and 1.6% in 2017. In comparison with the September 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for HICP inflation has been revised down slightly.\\n\\nTurning to the \\nmonetary analysis\\n, recent data confirm solid growth in broad money (M3), with the annual rate of growth of M3 increasing to 5.3% in October 2015 from 4.9% in September. Annual growth in M3 continues to be mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 growing at an annual rate of 11.8% in October, after 11.7% in September.\\n\\nLoan dynamics continued the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 0.6% in October, up from 0.1% in September. Despite these improvements, developments in loans to enterprises continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 1.2% in October, compared with 1.1% in September. Overall, the monetary policy measures in place since June 2014 have clearly improved borrowing conditions for both firms and households and credit flows across the euro area.\\n\\nTo sum up, a \\ncross-check\\n of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need for further monetary stimulus in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%.\\n\\nMonetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance supports economic activity. However, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively. Given continued high structural unemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area, the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective structural policies. In particular, actions to improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, are vital to increase productive investment, boost job creation and raise productivity. The swift and effective implementation of \\nstructural reforms\\n, in an environment of accommodative monetary policy, will not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but will also raise expectations of permanently higher incomes and accelerate the beneficial effects of reforms, thereby making the euro area more resilient to global shocks. \\nFiscal policies\\n should support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the European Union. Full and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact is crucial for confidence in our fiscal framework. At the same time, all countries should strive for a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies. \\n\\nWe are now at your disposal for questions.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"qa_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 273,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the ECB and Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the ECB\\n\\nQuestion (translation):\\n Two questions, if you will allow. During the last quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2001 you underestimated the slowdown in the United States and its impact on the euro zone, just as the governments did. Now, today, you seem to be very optimistic. You talk of a growth potential which will be fulfilled in 2001 and 2002. What facts and what data allow you to be so optimistic about this? After all, in the United States there are more and more alarm signals. That is my first question. Second question. The Ifo Institut published a rather interesting study analysing the reasons for the euro's weakness and it explained that if the euro is weak it is because Deutsche Mark are being sold in great quantities in eastern European countries and in Russia before the changeover to the euro. Their being sold is of course strengthening the dollar. Do you agree with this analysis?\\n\\nDuisenberg:\\n It may have struck you that I used the same language today as I used at the last press conference, namely that output growth is expected to be broadly in line with the trend potential growth. That is the best estimate that we have. And it is true that we already had to lower our expectations or forecasts some time ago, as is also reflected in the projections that were published in our last Monthly Bulletin. I recognise that the selling of Deutsche Mark circulating in particular in central and eastern Europe and in Russia may partly have an impact on the exchange rate. However, our estimates are that the sale of these Deutsche Mark to a very large extent takes the form of converting cash into bank deposits, and these can be euro area-denominated deposits. An additional factor is that we are seeing, in particular, a drastic decline in the circulation of large-denomination Deutsche Mark (and Guilder) banknotes coming possibly from the black economy. And we do not know, by definition of course, where they are. But we note that the circulation of these large-denomination notes is taking place. What we do not know is what that money is used for. Is it used to buy other currencies? Is it used to buy real estate? Is it used to buy other types of assets? That, by definition, we do not know. But then I would like to point out that the monetary impact of all this is very limited indeed. If you realise that notes in circulation represent about 6% - and no more - of the M3 figure, then you will also realise that part of that 6%, and really only a small part of those banknotes in circulation, are circulating outside the euro area. And again, part of that small part may then be converted into other assets, which makes the conclusion justified that the monetary impact of these moves in the run-up to the cash changeover is very limited indeed, if not negligible. We cannot deny that it may have some impact on the exchange rate as well. \\n\\nQuestion (translation):\\n Mr. Duisenberg, I wanted to ask how you would explain the weakness of the euro on the exchange rate market? Second question. Are you going to be present at the Eurogroup meeting on Monday in Brussels? And third question. Do you consider the ECB to be an institution which is ready to have a prime minister, or maybe an ex-prime minister, as its president? \\n\\nDuisenberg:\\n I cannot explain fully, as I have said on many occasions, the level of the euro at any particular moment. The tendency to stay in the neighbourhood of 84, 85, 86 cent against the dollar has already lasted three to four months. And all the factors that we have mentioned in the past explaining the depreciation of the euro now seem to have reversed. Yet this has not as yet had an impact on the exchange rate of the euro. But we remain convinced that the euro - and this is not an empty slogan - does indeed have a strong potential to appreciate. That is the considered conviction of the Governing Council. \\n\\nAs to the second question, I will be present at the Eurogroup meeting. \\n\\nAs for your last question I can only answer that the ECB is ready to have a former minister, namely a former finance minister, as its president, who is sitting right here, right now. \\n\\nQuestion:\\n Mr. President, are you worried that the various inflation rates within the EU Member States are drifting apart rather than getting closer together? The range now lies, if I am correctly informed, between 2.5% in France and up to 5.4% in the Netherlands. Is that range still acceptable to the ECB or is this some sort of warning sign?\\n\\nDuisenberg:\\n Well, the range as such is not that important. The fact that there are inflation differentials between the various regions in the euro area is - as we have explained many times, and, I am almost inclined to say - normal. These differentials will disappear and re-emerge in the future owing to different stages of development in the various countries. The fact that in the Netherlands, and fortunately to a lesser extent in Ireland, inflation has reached the figures they have, is in itself a cause for concern, particularly for the Dutch and the Irish authorities; and, to the extent that they could have spillover effects on other countries, it could also be a concern for us and the Governing Council. That is one reason why we put so much emphasis, even today, on the absolute need for moderate wage negotiations or wage moderation in the negotiating period which lies ahead.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n In recent months, your communication policy has been criticised by a number of observers and most recently by the OECD which has suggested that there are perhaps too many press conferences and that formal transparency is not effective transparency. Is that a fair criticism? If I could add another related question: you and Mr. Reynders have had a lot of dialogue outside of the formal meetings. Was his presence constructive and have you managed to improve the dialogue between you and the Belgian Minister of Finance?\\n\\nDuisenberg:\\n Are there too many press conferences? We are faced with the dilemma of, on the one hand, being as open and transparent as possible, and on the other hand, with what we would see were we to have fewer press conferences. I doubt whether we would also see less speculation and guesswork in your circles. We might even see more of this were we to have fewer press conferences. Therefore, next year, it is also our intention to stick to the same schedule of one press conference per month. The presence of the President of the EU Council has certainly helped to improve the dialogue, which we have entered into so often already, and which we again had today. But it is a dialogue, I hasten to add, between the Eurogroup and the Governing Council of the ECB as such, for which I am normally the spokesmen. However, there are occasions when I am not the spokesman, but there are equally qualified colleagues on the Governing Council who can engage in that dialogue in the same way as I do. However, I have noted with satisfaction that the Belgian Minister of Finance, in his capacity as the President of the Eurogroup and now the President of the EU Council, has already attended three out of the first fourteen meetings of the Governing Council, to each of which he has been invited.\\n\\nQuestion: \\nMr Noyer, you mentioned that the Governing Council of the ECB took a decision on the new conditions of employment, but you did not say what it was all about. Could you please tell us?\\n\\nNoyer: \\nIt is on a number of small issues, I mainly wanted to announce that in accordance with our policy of transparency, but there was nothing really that important that I needed to flag. It concerns, for instance, the updating of the internal rules for the prohibition of insider trading, which is normal corporate governance which all central banks and commercial banks in the world have to undertake. Consequently, we have improved the system and everything will be made known and published in detail, but that was the most prominent part of the change.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n Mr. Duisenberg, could you tell us how you react when you read reports that American officials urge the ECB to do more to help global growth? And that they would allow - or would want - the dollar to go higher over the longer term? And the second question: do you think there will be any effects on Euroland from the 275 basis points of Fed easing so far to date and, if so, when will we start seeing an effect here?\\n\\nDuisenberg:\\n Well, I believe that you should address those questions to the American authorities. I do not comment on the American monetary or fiscal policy in the context of global growth, and that means I also do not listen to advice I get from the outside on our monetary policy. Our monetary policy is clearly based on the well-known two-pillar strategy; that is decisive, and it is aimed primarily at maintaining price stability. Indeed, this is our primary aim and, as the Treaty says, only if there is no \\\"prejudice to the objective of price stability\\\", we do take into account the other general aims of the European Community, which are to maximise output growth and employment.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n Some countries like Italy and Germany say that they will only reach their budget balance by 2006 and so beyond their nominal targets. Are you worried about this and did you discuss the issue today with Mr. Reynders and Mr. Solbes?\\n\\nDuisenberg:\\n The issue was mentioned today. We are concerned that the current negative environment might reduce the impetus in various countries to reach the goals to which they have agreed in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact. And we do see some slippage in the determination to reach the goal of a balanced budget or even a small surplus. That is to say, we see some slippage in some countries in the determination to get there. That is a concern we raised and which I will raise again in our dialogue with the Eurogroup.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n President Duisenberg, two questions: on balance, how would you say that the risks to price stability balance out? And, second: how do you explain the fact that two days before an ECB meeting you go to the European Parliament and you say very clearly that there are no new data in the past two weeks that would make us change our assessment on interest rates, and still - after you say something like that - a quarter or some 35% of market participants think that there is a good chance you are going to do something at this meeting?\\n\\nDuisenberg:\\n Well I thought that I could not be clearer than that, but perhaps I should repeat what I said two days ago. I said the same thing as I said at this press conference, namely that our monetary policy stance seems appropriate in the current circumstances. I repeat today that the current monetary policy stance remains appropriate in the judgement of the Governing Council and should bring inflation back in line with price stability in the medium term. And this current monetary policy stance remains appropriate, in the opinion of the Governing Council, for some time to come. I cannot be clearer than that, I believe.\\n\\nQuestion: \\nMr. Duisenberg, in your speech in Strasbourg earlier this week, and again today, you said that you are looking - and you stressed this in particular - at developments in money supply, real GDP growth, price-setting behaviour and wage developments. Now, the current slowdown in economic growth would suggest that there are decreasing risks to price stability in the medium term in all four areas. Why then did you decide today to leave the interest rates unchanged? You claim to have a forward-looking strategy. Now, is this really forward-looking? And secondly, perhaps you will be...\\n\\nDuisenberg:\\n May I first answer this question? Our forward-looking strategy and our analysis indicates to us that it is likely that inflation will only come down to under 2% - which is our goal - in the course of next year. But then only just. And that makes us say, if we look one year or a year and a half ahead, that this forecast or expectation is based on the current monetary policy stance. So, if we were to change that in the direction in which you suggest, we would in all likelihood not reach that goal. And that is the reason why we did not cut interest rates and it is the reason why we regard our current monetary policy stance as appropriate, as I said to Mr. Sims, for some time to come.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n And now a second question. I think you will be celebrating your 66th birthday next week, if that is correct. Now, do you think this will have any impact on your career plans at the ECB?\\n\\nDuisenberg:\\n No. In particular because I will be celebrating it in the meeting of the Eurogroup.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n Mr. Duisenberg, again in your speech two days ago you seemed to have signalled today's decision. At least that is what many market watchers have been saying. Would you say that you have taken the criticism that your 10 May decision met with into account? And can we count in the future on clearer signals from the ECB on future rate decisions? \\n\\nDuisenberg:\\n Well, we have always maintained that we did not want to surprise markets. But sometimes a surprise is unavoidable. But it is not our policy to surprise markets. And I believe that in my statement of two days ago and in today's statement, which is basically a statement by the Governing Council, I have been as open and transparent and forward-looking as I possibly can be.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n Yes, thank you. And a short second question on the Stability Pact. Many countries might not meet the goals contained in the Pact or have been urging that it should be a topic at the next Eurogroup meeting. So how do you see that in your optimism on euro area growth, because you have been pretty optimistic about euro zone growth? Is this not a clear signal that governments are facing difficulties as a result of the global slowdown?\\n\\nDuisenberg: \\nWell, in so far as the goals are not being met for cyclical reasons - so that, in a way, automatic stabilisers are doing their work - we have no reason to be concerned. But it will be a reason for concern if structural developments, also in public deficits, do not work at the same pace or in the same way towards reaching the goals of the Stability and Growth Pact in a proper manner.\\n\\nQuestion (translation):\\n Mr. Duisenberg, on Saturday the G8 Finance Ministers are meeting in Rome. Now, that is a meeting without monetary policy spokespersons, but of course Mr. O'Neill, the US Secretary of the Treasury, \\\"Mr. Dollar\\\", will be there as well. Have you started to make any indirect contact with these G7 Finance Ministers in view of the meeting in Rome so that a consensus could be achieved if there were to be any questions on the euro or on the global economy, since the global economy is supposed to be one of the main topics at that meeting?\\n\\nDuisenberg:\\n The meeting in Rome, as I understand it, is meant as a preparatory meeting for the summit of the G8 Prime Ministers and Presidents. And for that particular preparatory meeting, no central banker will be present or has been invited, and that also means that I have made no contacts of the kind that you suggest. I have adequate contacts with the central banks of the G7 partners, including Mr. Greenspan.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n I still have two questions left. You said, I think, last time, that you agreed with the growth projections of most international institutions. But these projections are based on the assumption that you cut rates by half a percentage point. Do your projections also include this detail? Second, there is an aspect of the data that you did not comment upon, and that is the significant decrease in inflation in Germany and Italy. May inflation come down more quickly?\\n\\nDuisenberg:\\n In our projections the monetary policy stance or the level of interest rates is a so-called exogenous variable, so we do not assume any change, strictly for - I am almost inclined to say - \\\"scientific reasons\\\". We had a high figure in May. We expect the June figure already to show a decline from that level. But as I have said on various occasions, mainly because of the base effects of the development twelve months ago which, month after month, will fall out of the figures, the road to the level under 2% may be a bumpy one. There may be months in which inflation stabilises or there may even be months in which it shows a further rise. But there will be more months in which it shows a decline. And the decline we expect for the month of June will already be, in our expectation, and according to first indications, not insubstantial, or will be considerable. \\n\\nQuestion:\\n The European Commission is discussing plans to regulate the fees that banks levy on transfers within the euro area that are non-domestic. Do you support these plans?\\n\\nDuisenberg:\\n We take a neutral position on this. We support the aim, namely that over time we hope that the costs of transferring money abroad or domestically will be the same. And we urge banks to work in that direction. Now this process is being strengthened by the current consideration of the Commission to issue a regulation to this effect, thereby forcing the private sector to act in a certain way. We have also considered whether we should do the same, but we think that this would run counter to our mandate to act in a market-oriented way and to let the market do its work freely.\\n\\n \\n\\nCONTACT\\n\\nEuropean Central Bank\\n\\nDirectorate General Communications\\n\\nSonnemannstrasse 20\\n\\n60314 Frankfurt am Main, Germany\\n\\n+49 69 1344 7455\\n\\nmedia@ecb.europa.eu\\n\\nReproduction is permitted provided that the source is acknowledged.\\n\\nMedia contacts\",\n          \"Transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, and Lucas Papademos, Vice-President of the ECB\\n\\nQuestion: \\nFirst of all, a bit of housekeeping: were other options discussed apart from the 50 basis point cut?\\n\\nSecondly, on the issue of quantitative easing, there has been a lot of discussion about quantitative easing not only with the ECB, of course, but with the ECB sparked by remarks by Axel Weber and Christian Noyer referring to commercial paper programmes, and that the ECB could embark on buying commercial papers. Was that discussed, has that been an issue? \\n\\nAnd in that context, thirdly, with that, how concerned are you at the ECB that the ECB\\u2019s balance sheet is getting longer and longer and, in fact, there has been a great deal of quantitative easing already?\\n\\n \\nTrichet:\\n On your first question, we had, as always, an in-depth discussion on the present situation, on all the observations, which were made, on all figures, on staff projections and on the appropriate policy decision in the present circumstances. After this thorough discussion we concluded by a consensus on the decision which we took. I have just mentioned what we did as regards interest rates. I emphasise the fact that we decided to diminish our main refinancing operation rate by 50 basis points. We also decided not to change the width of the corridor, which is, between the deposit facility and the main refinancing rate, a full percentage point. So, we decided today to put our deposit facility at the level of 0.50%, which is very, very low. This decision to put our deposit facility at that level - taking into account the fact that the unlimited supply of liquidity is driving the overnight rate quite close to the deposit facility - is of great importance. We also decided today, which will be elaborated in a press release that you will have immediately after this press conference, to continue the fixed rate tender procedure with full allotment for all main refinancing operations, special-term refinancing operations and supplementary and regular longer-term refinancing operations for as long as needed and in any case beyond the end of 2009. And we have decided to continue with the current frequency and maturity profile of the supplementary longer-term refinancing operations and special-term refinancing operations for as long as needed and in any case beyond the end of 2009. These are the decisions which we have taken today. \\n\\nAs regards your second question on quantitative easing or non-standard measures \\u2013 this would be the way I would describe these measures \\u2013 as you have underlined yourself, we are already using non-standard measures. I think you were absolutely right to say that. With the very substantial enlargement of the eligibility of our collateral, and that in combination with the supply of liquidity on an unlimited basis which has been decided by the Governing Council, we are using non-standard measures, which have had important consequences. I mentioned one of the consequences as regards the positioning of the EONIA rate. Another consequence is that our own balance sheet has augmented substantially, and, if you wish to have an order of magnitude we have an augmentation of the risk that we are taking ourselves in our own balance sheet since the start of the turbulences in August 2007, which is of the order of magnitude of 600 billion euro, of the order of magnitude of 800 billion dollars. This represents a little bit more than 6% of the GDP of the euro area, so this is substantial. As regards further non-standard measures, on top of the two measures I have mentioned, on top of what we have decided today \\u2013 to say that we would continue as long as needed and beyond the end of the year \\u2013 we are discussing and studying possible new non-standard measures. I will not elaborate on that; we had absolutely no pre-commitment to any particular non-standard measure. I don\\u2019t exclude anything. I will give you a rendezvous when, if and when, we decide. Then I would be happy to explain what we have decided. Again, we are studying possible additional non-standard measures.\\n\\nQuestion\\n: \\nWith the main refinancing rate at 1.5% do you think you are getting close to the limit? Last time you said you considered 0% rates inappropriate. Do you still think so? \\n\\nAnd my second question would be relating to potential non-conventional measures you may embark on in the future. Some of the non-conventional measures used by other central banks very much depend on the cooperation and indemnity of their treasuries, like the Bank of England or the Fed depend on their finance ministries to provide indemnity for any sort of default on commercial papers or anything else. So in the absence of a single European treasury, have you started discussions or pushed for discussions with various finance ministers or at the Eurogroup level to come to some sort of conclusion? I believe Mr Juncker was at the meeting today, was that raised at any level? Or was it raised at some sort of seminar or anything else? \\n\\n \\nTrichet:\\n As regards your first question, I confirm what I have already said: we see a number of drawbacks associated with a zero rate level. As regards the present level of the main refinancing operations, we did not decide ex-ante that this was the lowest point that we could attain. Further decisions will depend on facts, figures and judgement of the Governing Council.\\n\\nAs regards your second question on the non-standard measures, there is no pre-commitment for any kind of non-standard measure. I exclude nothing. It would be the decision of the Governing Council and we are looking at it. At this stage there has been no discussion with executive branches as regards any help or any guarantees or any support that could be given. And it is not an avenue which fits necessarily correctly with our own framework. We did not ask for any kind of help when we engaged in this very important consequence of the non-standard measures, namely the increase in the size of our overall balance sheet. That being said, if we exclude nothing, there is nothing that would substantiate such an avenue at this stage.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n I have a couple of questions. You have just said you are studying the implementation of non-standard measures. Does that mean you are studying the process by which you might implement them or you are studying the need for them? \\n\\nSecondly, I\\u2019m not an economist and maybe I\\u2019m a little bit confused. You say in the statement \\u201cafter today\\u2019s decision we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term\\u201d. If I did the maths right, in 2010 the mid-point is 1% and both 0.6 and 1.4 are well below your definition of price stability, so what am I missing?\\n\\nAnd my last question, you also said today\\u2019s decision was a consensual decision \\u2013 could you give us a little bit more detail on that, what were the other options discussed?\\n\\n \\nTrichet:\\n On the non-standard measures, we are discussing of course both the need and the process. And any decision would suppose that we see the need and that we agree on the process. \\n\\nOn price stability, we have the staff projections \\u2013 although we do not ourselves underwrite the staff projections, they are the judgement of the staff. Let me mention just one point among many others: the present methodology is based upon existing market interest rates, the observation of the yield curve and the evolution of market interest rates. It is part of a methodology that is very much an agreed methodology, generally considered to be state of the art. Before the methodology just mentioned, we had another methodology which used the working assumption that you take the interest rates where they are and they do not change: Interest rate policy was unchanged in the previous methodology. According to various models of the euro area economy if our staff would still use the previous methodology, the projections would display substantially more growth and significantly more inflation in the euro area economy. And if I take the level of interest rates that we have decided today \\u2013 not the interest rates which existed at the moment of the projections \\u2013 then the impact would be even higher in terms of growth and inflation. Our decision today takes into account precisely the fact that we are not passive ourselves, and we use all information available to make our judgments. So we trust, as I said on behalf of the Governing Council, that with today\\u2019s decision we are ensuring price stability over the medium term.\\n\\nRegarding your third question, I will confirm that there was a consensus, after a very in-depth discussion as we are in a very multi-dimensional, complex and uncertain world. \\n\\nQuestion: \\nI am sure markets are going to price in further cuts in the ECB interest rates in the coming months. Would you want to say anything to discourage them, or does your statement that you put in today saying that after today\\u2019s decision we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term mean that, if events unfold as set out in your base line scenario, there would be no need for any further interest rate cuts? \\n\\nAnd, secondly, there are a lot of issues around at the moment, but, just to focus on one or two: if we talked about classic quantitative easing in the true sense of the form that the Bank of England has announced today, would you imagine such a programme being either effective or practical in the context of the eurozone? I am not asking if you are going to do it, but given that economists seem to argue that quantitative easing does work do you think they are correct? \\n\\nAnd third, if I might just ask you to comment on the situation in eastern European economies, and specifically the role that the European Central Bank might take in the future. What would your message be to politicians from some of those countries who are suggesting the ECB could do more, for instance by accepting collateral in assets from some of the local currencies?\\n\\n \\nTrichet\\n: On the first question, as I said, we did not decide ex-ante that we were at the lowest level. If justified by facts and figures, if some of the risks that I mentioned are materialising, I clearly won\\u2019t rule out the main policy rate being changed, indeed going down. That is clear. I will also mention the fact that, as regards the interest rate of the deposit facility the present level, which is 0.5%, is already a very, very low rate. These are the two comments I will make in response to your first question. \\n\\nOn your second question, again, we are reflecting on what is likely to be done. You know that we are in a different situation in comparison with other sister institutions over the Channel or over the Atlantic. We do not have the same financial system in front of us. From the outset, we have been extraordinarily forthcoming in comparison with the other central banks as regards collateral. We have even enlarged the list of eligible collateral. The commercial banks are playing a much more important role in the euro area than it is the case in the United States in particular, but perhaps also in the United Kingdom. So it is not surprising that we have concentrated our attention on commercial banks and on being as forthcoming as possible as regards this channel. On top of the openness to the eligibility of collateral, you will remember that we were the first to go for longer-term refinancing. We are engaging in this unlimited supply of liquidity on a longer-term basis, and today we have taken a new very important decision to pursue this concept of unlimited refinancing for as long as needed and at least beyond the end of the year. All this shows that, as regards non-standard measures, we are concentrating very much on what fits the very structure of the euro area. That being said, we do not feel that we should exclude other operations. At this stage I would prefer to qualify them \\u2013 and this is also the way Ben Bernanke is qualifying such operations \\u2013 more as credit easing than quantitative easing. Again, in terms of quantity, we already have a very significant level of non-standard quantitative risk-taking that is very visible. \\n\\nIn response to your final question on eastern Europe at this stage our position would be that it is extremely important that we do not change any frameworks. We have established rules concerning membership of ERM II or the euro. And sticking to the rules as they are is very important for the stability of the European Union as a whole. It is not good to suggest that some are in such a weak situation that you would amend the rules for the sake of that situation. I feel that it is important to stick to the present framework as it is. \\n\\nQuestion:\\n Mr Trichet, two questions, please, one is: Could you again elaborate a bit more on your or the ECB\\u2019s problems with zero interest rate policy; the arguments which would prevent the ECB from lowering the main refinancing rate to zero. \\n\\nAnd secondly, another question on the non-standard measures: If you cannot tell us what measures the Council would prefer at the moment, could you at least give us a sort of time frame for when a decision on this might take place. Or do you think you have unlimited time to decide when to pursue those non-standard measures, because time is a bit short at the moment, is it not?\\n\\n \\nTrichet:\\n On your first question, time is short and that is why we are taking important decisions. We have taken important decisions in the past few months and we have taken important decisions today with commitments that go beyond the end of the year. \\n\\nAs regards your second question on non-standard measures, as I said we are in discussions. I am not ruling anything out. We are not pre-committed to anything. When the time comes, you will know what we have decided. And I shall give you regular updates at our press briefings, but I do not pre-commit to any particular time. In any case, we have proved that we have been able to take decisions at any time when necessary including in exceptional unforeseen circumstances. And, as I have repeatedly said today, uncertainty is the mark of the time. With regard to why we think that zero interest rates would be very inconvenient, I will not elaborate any further. It is clearly an assessment that we have made.\\n\\nQuestion: \\nJust to follow up on your outlook for price stability which goes below 2% next year. How high would you say is the risk of deflation in the euro area? \\n\\nAnd my second question is: you know that there are also preparations in the euro area by politicians on how to assist countries in trouble within the euro area, not eastern Europe. I was wondering whether you would say you support these preparations or would you say that this goes too far and violates the Treaty?\\n\\n \\nTrichet: \\nOn your first question, we are looking very carefully and constantly at the possible risk of deflation \\u2013 as the OECD and the IMF are doing. The conclusion of the international institutions in general is that such risks are very minimal in our case. And one of the reasons why they are very minimal is that, to substantiate deflation, not only inflation on the basis of the CPI observed during a sufficiently long period of time must be negative but must it must also drive inflation expectations themselves to be negative, so that you have the downward spiral that characterises deflation. In our case, thanks to our definition of price stability and thanks to the very clear understanding by economic agents such as seen via the Survey of Professional Forecasters, since the introduction of the euro we have had quite a remarkable anchoring of inflation expectations. And when you look at the medium-term inflation expectations, whether they are extracted from surveys or whether they are extracted from the financial markets, on a medium-term basis they are very well-anchored. We must take care of that, it is not something which can be taken for granted eternally, but it helps us considerably in circumstances in which there are significant inflationary risks. We proved that we were able to weather periods which were very demanding in times of upside risks for inflation. It helps us also very much to weather periods in which, on the contrary, there might be downward pressure on inflation. So no, there is no substantiation of any significant risk of deflation and we are considerably helped by our definition of price stability and by the anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. \\n\\nAs regards your second question on the issue of members of the euro area that could be in extreme difficulty, first of all the euro area is an area where you have considerable automatic help through the very existence of the single currency itself. For instance the balance of payment deficit, if any, is financed automatically by virtue of belonging to the euro area. Let us not forget that. I say regularly when I am asked more direct questions that I do not comment on absurd hypotheses. I have confidence in the capacity of the governments of the euro area, in line with their own pre-eminent responsibility, to convince their own people and the markets that they are going in the right direction and that they are credible as regards the medium- to long-term path for sound fiscal policies that I mentioned on behalf of the Governing Council in the introductory remarks. \\n\\nQuestion:\\n Three questions Mr Trichet. First of all you have a statement in here where you speak about how it has become clear that key ECB interest rates are being passed through the monetary transmission mechanism. Should we understand that as an argument against additional non-standard measures that so to speak the mechanisms are returning to their previous functioning? \\n\\nA second question regarding the rules you apply to entering the euro zone. Those of us within this room know you are very attached to the Treaty but you do have some flexibility on how you define the best performing three members of the euro zone in calculating the inflation target. At this point that formula seems a bit odd, because it would suggest that countries need to deflate in order to meet criteria, which I am sure you do not want them to do. Have you given any thought in this direction to whether this is still appropriate going forward? \\n\\nAnd for my third question, I would like to hear your thoughts on what you feel western Europe\\u2019s responsibilities are to the new EU Member States that joined in 2004. There is a situation of mutual dependence there in many ways, it is obviously not standard procedure to \\u201dso to speak\\u201d grab your neighbours under the arms in difficult times in the EU, but these are not normal times. What are your thoughts on that?\\n\\n \\nTrichet: \\nOn your first question we mentioned that the pass-through was functioning in a way which was not significantly hampered. That is the description we are using. It is true that when we look at the functioning of our money market and the impact that we have through our policy decisions on the EURIBOR market interest rates, including three-month interest rates for instance, we have observed that the functioning of the money market and the pass-through of these monetary policy decisions was not significantly hampered. This is not to say that we exclude ex-ante additional non-standard measures, because I said that if it functions quite well in our judgement, despite the acute tensions that we have to cope with it is precisely because we have taken non-standard measures. Again, to be clear on the response to your question, we would not exclude other non-standard measures. \\n\\nOn your second question at this stage we are in agreement with the European Commission and with the governments as a group in considering that it is not appropriate to reflect on transforming or loosening the criteria. We do not think that it would help anybody at this stage, neither the countries concerned nor the euro area itself. \\n\\nOn the third point, I would make the following comments. You mention \\u201cwestern Europe\\u201d so your question is independent of belonging or not to the euro area. You assume it is possible to make a distinction between the western part of Europe and the eastern part of Europe, which I do not like since we are all on exactly the same footing and the only pertinent differences for me are that some are members of the euro area, others are members of ERM II, others are members of the European Union without being members of the euro area or ERM II and others are out of the European Union itself. And one could also say that you have candidate countries and non-candidate countries. So these are the pertinent distinctions that you can make between the various countries. The European countries in general themselves, and particularly the eastern and central European countries, are very keen on saying that they exist in their own right and that they have their own economic and financial features and characteristics. Some of them would say that they are in a situation which is difficult and would ask for help, while others would say that they are in a situation which is solid and strong and resilient and they should not all be confused. If and when particular countries might have major difficulties, it is always possible, as has been proved in several cases, that there is help available from the European Union itself and from the European Commission and which is backed by governments. There is additional help, which can be given on a bilateral basis, as has been the case for Latvia for instance. There is also help which can come from international institutions, such when the IMF is involved. We ourselves, as we have done for some countries, can have repo agreements that would also be helpful in those circumstances. But that is for those countries that have an exceptional difficulty and that are calling for help to finance a recovery programme that is convincing. But we are all on the same continent and we must all care for our own resilience, because the resilience of the euro area itself is very important for all our partners. Our first duty is to understand that we are all interdependent and that it is very important that we continue to be \\u201cgood clients\\u201d for the eastern and central European countries that are exporting to the euro area. \\n\\nQuestion: \\nYou said you did not decide that you are at the lowest level when it comes to the refinancing rate, yet you see drawbacks to zero rates. What does that mean? When it comes to the floor, where do you see it?\\n\\n \\nTrichet:\\n I will not comment more on that.\\n\\nQuestion: \\nOkay, if I could then ask you, could you tell us about the ECB\\u2019s accounts? Were they in surplus last year? How much did the eurozone central banks earn on liquidity operations, and were there any write-downs or losses associated with holding back collateral?\\n\\n \\nTrichet: \\nThat is an excellent question, because I wanted to say a word on that. So, I would first mention the European Central Bank itself. We approved today the audited annual accounts of the ECB for the year ending 31 December 2008. At the end of this press conference you will have the press release. We had a surplus in 2008 of \\u20ac2.661 billion, which compares with a surplus of \\u20ac286 million in 2007 that reflected very much the effects of the euro\\u2019s appreciation against the US dollar and, to a lesser extent, the Japanese yen. So again we had a surplus of approximately \\u20ac2.7 billion in 2008. As regards the risk exposure of the ECB, based upon our assessment, an amount of \\u20ac1.339 billion was transferred from this surplus to the provision that we are making against foreign exchange risk, interest rate and gold price risks. So we declared a net result of \\u20ac1.322 billion. The provision would be used to cover possible losses arising from the risks that I mentioned. Today we have decided to distribute the remaining \\u20ac116 million, because we had already transferred to the national central banks the bulk of the net result, namely \\u20ac1.2 billion. You will have all the details in a press release after the press conference.\\n\\nNow, I would like to refer to the Eurosystem monetary policy operations in 2008, not only at the level of the ECB, but at the level of the Eurosystem as a whole. The income from monetary policy operations is expected to amount to around \\u20ac28.7 billion in 2008, which is superior to what we had observed in 2007 for Eurosystem income from monetary operations. In 2007 we had \\u20ac23.2 billion. If I now take the aggregate net result of the Eurosystem national central banks, including the distribution of the net result that the ECB has been distributed to the NCBs and which goes onto their own balance sheet, then this net result is estimated to be approximately \\u20ac16.8 billion for 2008. The year before, the aggregate net result was \\u20ac15.2 billion. Again this information will be detailed in a press release, which will be available after the press conference. In the autumn of 2008 we had five counterparties that defaulted on refinancing operations undertaken by the Eurosystem, namely Lehman Brothers Bankhaus AG, three subsidiaries of Icelandic banks, and Indover NL. The total nominal value of the Eurosystem\\u2019s claims on these credit institutions amounted to some \\u20ac10.3 billion at the end of 2008. We have looked at this, and the decision we have taken is that any shortfall, if it were to materialise, on the amount of claims that we have, should eventually be shared in full by the Eurosystem NCBs in accordance with Article 32.4 of the Statute of the ESCB, in proportion to the prevailing ECB capital key shares of these NCBs in 2008. As a matter of prudence, we also decided at the level of the Governing Council, that the NCBs should establish their respective shares of an appropriate total provision in their annual accounts for 2008 as a buffer against possible risks arising for the monetary policy operations. The size of the total provision at the level of the Eurosystem as a whole will amount to \\u20ac5.7 billion. The net figures I gave you \\u2013 for the level of the net result of the Eurosystem - namely approximately \\u20ac16.8 billion is calculated after this provisioning. Exactly the same applies to the ECB. The ECB has made provisions and the net result we have distributed to the national central banks was after our provision. To give you an idea of the order of magnitude of our provisioning, when I pile up all the provisioning we have made in the ECB \\u2013 I am speaking of the ECB alone, and not of the Eurosystem \\u2013 that it is now around \\u20ac4 billion. It is the total provisioning we have made in order to face up to potential risks.\\n\\nQuestion: \\nI just wanted to pick up on your unprompted remarks, I think you made them twice, about the deposit rate, that you decided to keep the corridor at 100 basis points. Can we assume - is it right to interpret it so - that you are actively considering narrowing the corridor again, and that you may actually do that before you embark on any other non-conventional measures? And also, if you are saying that 1.5% is not the limit, could we see a rate cut as soon as next month?\\n\\n \\nTrichet: \\nAgain, we will do whatever is necessary and I will not comment more on future decisions. I said that we had not decided ex-ante that we are at the lowest point as regards the main refinancing operation interest rate. I also mentioned that at 0.5% the deposit interest rate was at a very, very low level, also taking into account that the unlimited supply of liquidity which we operate, and are bound to operate for a long period of time, is something which pushes down the EONIA, not far away from the level of this deposit facility interest rate. That is the only remark I make, but you, of course, took it rightly so. \\n\\nQuestion:\\n You say you are ruling out no possible measures that you might take, these unorthodox measures, but your hands must be tied to some degree by your own charter. Are there certain things that you can rule out at this point, perhaps with regard to buying commercial paper? You are not the Federal Reserve; you are not the Bank of England. To what extent are your hands tied? \\n\\n \\nTrichet:\\n Our hands are not tied at all. We will do whatever we judge appropriate, taking into account the situation. We are not exactly in the same situation as the United States or the United Kingdom, and everybody knows that. So we have to optimise what we do. As regards the set of non-standard measures, I have already said that we have already adopted a large number of non-standard measures, and I can elaborate more on that. We will do what we judge appropriate. Our hands are not tied; I am ruling nothing out, as I have said. If our hands were tied in a certain direction, I would say at this stage that we had a sense that we were ruling out this or that. But I\\u2019m not saying that. I\\u2019m not committing myself to anything, and the fact that sister institutions are doing this or that does not mean that we should do the same. I have said, since the very beginning we have been in a very different situation. We also have to take into account the fact that the commercial banks are our main channel on this side of the Atlantic, by comparison with the other side of the Atlantic. \\n\\nNow, let me say, in order to ensure that you don\\u2019t miss any information, that the next Governing Council meeting and press conference on 2 April will take place here, and not in Italy, as it had been envisaged at a certain point in time. So, I want to make it clear that the next meeting will be in Frankfurt. We will have the external meeting in Luxembourg on 2 July. You know that and it is published on the website. I just wanted to confirm that. And it is on 8 October that we will be in Italy.\\n\\n \\n\\nCONTACT\\n\\nEuropean Central Bank\\n\\nDirectorate General Communications\\n\\nSonnemannstrasse 20\\n\\n60314 Frankfurt am Main, Germany\\n\\n+49 69 1344 7455\\n\\nmedia@ecb.europa.eu\\n\\nReproduction is permitted provided that the source is acknowledged.\\n\\nMedia contacts\",\n          \"Transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, and Lucas Papademos, Vice-President of the ECB\\n\\nQuestion:\\n The first question I would really like to ask is about the future direction of the European Central Bank\\u2019s policy and I was wondering if you could tell us a bit more about how much accommodation the European Central Bank still sees left in its monetary policy and how much of that accommodation needs to be withdrawn to ensure price stability over the medium term? \\n\\n \\nTrichet:\\n On this point I will be very clear. There is not an \\u201cex ante\\u201d decision of the Governing Council at today\\u2019s meeting to engage in a series of interest rate increases. We have decided to increase rates by 0.25 percentage point because we judged that, with this new level, we are in line with our duty, our mandate, which is to preserve price stability and to be credible over time in preserving price stability. It is our responsibility vis \\u00e1 vis the 311 million people in the euro area, our fellow citizens. It is our duty because it is what the Treaty is calling for. And it is the best way to anchor inflationary expectations. We will see, then, what the new information, the new facts and the new figures are that will permit the Governing Council to make a judgement and take new decisions. We are not engaging, ex ante, in a series of interest rate increases. And, as I have said, we will continue to monitor closely all developments with regard to risks to price stability. \\n\\nQuestion: \\nTwo questions. I assume that the projections that you will release today do not incorporate today\\u2019s interest rate decision. And, if that is correct, if you re-ran the projections with a rate of 2.25%, would the 2007 inflation mid-point be lower than the 2% you have projected today? And the second question I have is: What do you make of all the political voices that you have been hearing, from finance ministers, for example, about your policy?\\n\\n \\nTrichet:\\n As regards your first question to the extent that the short-term market rates had already anticipated our today\\u2019s move this move was incorporated in the Eurosystem staff projections.\\n\\nAs regards the various voices that you mention, I will only say that we are fortunate to live in a lively set of democracies. We are fortunate to live in a European democracy which is itself lively. I myself, as you know, recently addressed the European Parliament. And I would mention, \\nen passant\\n, that I address the European Parliament as frequently as my colleague Alan Greenspan addresses the US parliament \\u201con the hill\\u201d. I have said, as clearly as possible, what we thought and what our own understanding of the situation was. We try to be as transparent and predictable as possible. We are not influenced \\u2013 as stated in the Treaty, which is very clear in that respect \\u2013 by any so-called \\u201cvoices\\u201d or recommendations. We have a duty not to be influenced \\u2013 in any respect. Not up or down. Because it was suggested we do this or that. Our colleagues, the Vice-President and myself, all members of the Governing Council know that we have a mandate \\u2013 a very clear mandate \\u2013 given by the Treaty. We know what the people of Europe are calling on us to do. We are responsible for price stability. 311 million people are expecting us to deliver price stability. And their message is very clear: they are asking us to live up to our mandate. That is the message of the 311 million people. And because we live up to our mandate, we can reinforce confidence in those 311 million people. And we also inspire confidence to investors and savers in Europe and the world in a way which allows us to deliver the lowest market rates that existed in the most credible part of Europe, from a monetary point of view, before the euro. Which is an incredible success. And let me mention, \\nen passant\\n, that the 2% rate that we have maintained for two and a half years while very solidly anchoring inflationary expectations was a level of interest rates lower than the lowest rate that the Bundesbank had ever set since its creation, since World War II. The Bundesbank itself had never set its discount rate at the level of 2%. We were lower than its lowest level. And not for 80 million Germans, but for 311 million people in Europe. And again, this level of market rates, this level of market interest rates over five years, ten years, thirty years and fifty years is duet to the confidence in our own Central Bank. Our own credibility. The credibility of the Governing Council of the ECB. Among those people who are looking at what we are doing and taking decisions on a day-by-day \\u2013 even a minute-by-minute \\u2013 basis, you have non-euro area residents holding approximately EUR 3.5 trillion in negotiable instruments and liquid deposits. Those people are making judgements on our credibility to deliver price stability over ten years, over thirty years and over fifty years. Because we are credible they give us low market interest rates favourable for growth and job creation. And that is the reason why we are faithful to our mandate. \\n\\nQuestion:\\n Could we make a distinction between the long-term level of interest rates, which you have noted are historically low, and the effect of a price increase on the tentative recovery in Europe? If indeed, as you imply, there\\u2019s an accommodative overhang and you are correcting this, you are making this structural move, is this the right point in the cycle to be doing it when domestic demand in Europe is just coming out of a recovery? Would it not have been better to make such a structural correction when we are further into a cyclical recovery? You might note that this is the criticism made by the ECB Shadow Council, which includes a former head of the Monetary Policy Stance Division of the ECB. How would you respond to that observation?\\n\\n \\nTrichet:\\n If I am not misled \\u2013 but perhaps I was reading things too rapidly \\u2013 they were divided: ten on one side and eight on the other side. So in this shadow group there are various views. Again, before the euro was set up nobody was predicting that we would be as credible as the most credible central banks. Every economist, every market participant, investors and savers were thinking that there would be a loss of credibility, which was after all understandable because we were going to merge highly credible currencies and currencies that were not at all as credible. So a kind of average of credibility and confidence was what the observers, economists, investors and savers were expecting. Because of our remarkable own credibility we could deliver this extraordinary low level of rates, which had been the privilege of only a part of Europe and not the privilege of 311 million people. Today we have judged unanimously that the increased level of risks to price stability embedded in the situation were such that today\\u2019s correction was necessary to fulfil our mandate and to maintain the full credibility that we have. I have to say that when you look at the figures extracted from the various bond markets \\u2013 it\\u2019s not literature that we are discussing its fact, figures, numbers, arithmetic \\u2013 when we said that we would moderately increase our rates, we gained in terms of credibility. We have gained in terms of forward break-even rates and we have proved that our own interaction with the European and global markets has led them to judge that we were right in doing what we have done. And in so doing, we will allow growth in Europe to be sustained and not short-lived. That is the conviction of the 18 members of the Governing Council. \\n\\nQuestion: \\nMr President, you spoke of divisions on the ECB Shadow Council. Were there any divisions on the Governing Council? \\n\\n \\nTrichet:\\n I said that we were unanimous. \\n\\nQuestion: \\nJust a follow-up on that last point: I think it would be helpful to lots of people if you could give us your account of how the debate has evolved within the Governing Council in recent weeks and months. You said the Council is unanimous on today\\u2019s decision, but did anyone propose not raising interest rates today? Did anyone raise the idea of increasing them by 50 basis points? In this connection, perhaps you could tell us a little about your level of vigilance going forward? We became very used to you saying \\u201cstrong vigilance, we can act any time\\u201d. That language has now disappeared. Is that because the 25 basis points mean you don\\u2019t have to say those things at this precise point in time? And if I may ask one other question on your profile for inflation, has inflation now peaked? When do you expect it to go back to below 2%?\\n\\n \\nTrichet:\\n First on the Governing Council sentiment. You might remember that we had indicated that we were in a mode of strong vigilance in Athens and I remember that all of you noted that the sentiment of the Governing Council was different in Athens in comparison with what it had been a month before. We judged that the risks to price stability were increasing, were on the upside, and I made that very clear in responding to questions. We confirmed the view that risks were on the upside and had augmented at the press conference and in the introductory remarks a month ago, and that was again noted by everybody. It was so clearly noted that it triggered a great number of voices \\u2013 that have already been mentioned \\u2013 commenting on interest rates. We have various views inside the Governing Council, as it is necessary. Collegial wisdom implies that you exchange all possible information, arguments and analyses. The pertinent entity which is the Governing Council relies very much on a collegial, very confident and very comprehensive exchanges of views. And there emerges from that exchange of views a majority sentiment which can from time to time be a unanimous sentiment. We unanimously decided today to do what I have already announced, and of course we had various views, which were exchanged. Some perhaps could have imagined that we would have gone higher, and others perhaps would have thought before the discussion that we could wait a little longer. But after the discussion those who wanted to go higher considered the move that I am commenting today to be correct, and the others thought that it was appropriate to join in and to take the decision I announced, which again has been taken unanimously. You had a series of questions on vigilance. I will only say again what I have said very clearly. We are not, ex ante, engaging in a series of interest rate increases. We will monitor all developments closely, as I have said, with respect to risks to price stability. And we will continue to do exactly what is necessary to deliver price stability and to be credible. We will maintain the confidence of households in price stability, and maintain the confidence of investors and savers over time. We will solidly anchor inflation expectations and preserve a yield curve which is exceptionally favourable for growth and job creation in Europe. All this relies on our European and global credibility. \\n\\nQuestion: \\nTwo questions. First, in July 2003 after the Federal Reserve System had begun its tightening cycle, you went out of your way to emphasise the different conditions in Europe. \\u201cWe are in different universes\\u201d, you said at the time. Now that the Federal Reserve System has over a year of a tightening cycle behind it and is no longer, shall we say, the chief supplier of cheap money in the world as the ECB now is, I want to invite you to repeat this statement. Second, you have emphasised, as you have many other times, that you need to be as transparent and predictable as possible in your actions. A few weeks ago, you stood up at a banking conference in Frankfurt and dropped a strong hint that you would do today what you have indeed done. There are many banking conferences in Frankfurt; you will have many opportunities to do the same thing. Is there anything in today\\u2019s Governing Council statement that would prevent you from doing that? \\n\\n \\nTrichet:\\n I am not sure if I understand your question correctly.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n Is there anything in this statement that would prevent you from making a similar statement as you did. \\n\\n \\nTrichet: \\nIf I understand the question correctly, certainly not! But allow me to mention two things: First, the Federal Reserve is responsible for price stability, which is a necessary condition for growth and job creation, as you will find out in the speeches of my colleague, Alain Greenspan. We share exactly the same sentiment: price stability is a necessary condition for growth, sustainable growth and sustainable job creation. Not per se, unfortunately, a sufficient condition, but a necessary condition. The Federal Reserve does what it has to do and we do what we have to do. The judges are the observers, households, market participants, investors and savers and the facts and figures I was mentioning. I recommend that you look at the figures. This morning I looked at the markets to check the differential between the US ten-year rate, for instance, and the Euro ten-year rate. I am not sure that the large public perceives that this differential is in the magnitude of 1%, a full 100 basis points. \\n\\nSecond, as regards the banking conference in Frankfurt which took place approximately a fortnight ago, I did not stand up, I was there at the banking conference, I had been invited, I was on the spot, and the Chairman of the panel, Mr Walter, asked me \\u201ccould you tell us, Sir, what we need to know and to understand on interest rates and the monetary policy of the ECB\\u201d. It was a direct question, which I was asked when I was on the podium. I responded in what I trusted was necessary, namely to give those of you attending clarity and appropriate information and to give, through you, of course, market participants, observers, savers and public opinion the information that would be useful at that stage. We really trust that transparency is very important. At that time, there were so many voices speaking on interest rates, not inside the Governing Council but outside of it, that perhaps some of you might have had trouble understanding exactly what was happening, and I thought that it was appropriate to provide this information.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n Two questions: following up your previous answer, does that mean that you did not discuss the statement you made on November 18, 2005 with the other Governing Council members? \\n\\n \\nTrichet:\\n I will respond immediately: I said that I conveyed the sentiment of the Governing Council.\\n\\nQuestion: \\nDo you expect core inflation to rise and does that not imply higher interest rates? And/or would you describe your position as being totally neutral on interest rates? Do you have any bias at the moment?\\n\\n \\nTrichet:\\n Two very different questions. As you know, we do not follow core inflation. We follow headline inflation. And we are very clear as regards our monetary policy concept. We also say that it is extremely important to look to the medium term. In accordance with our mandate, we have to deliver price stability in the medium term, which means that we must understand what is transitory and what is permanent in the inflationary phenomenon. In the introductory remark, we mentioned the fact that, from time to time, we hear voices mentioning that core inflation \\u2013 that is, their definition of core inflation \\u2013 is the best predictor of future inflation. When you look at research, facts and figures, it is clear that it is much more complex. There are cases where core inflation is a good predictor. However, there are a lot of cases where core inflation is not a good predictor. This is because, contrary to what some are arguing \\u2013 that headline inflation will go down to join core inflation \\u2013 it is, in fact, the opposite that holds, that core inflation is going up to join headline inflation. It is therefore very misleading to trust that core inflation (of which there are various definitions) is always a good predictor. In any case, as you know, we look at all the information at our disposal, separating what we trust is transitory from what we trust is permanent. An additional remark we made was that there is now little doubt that a large part of what we are observing in the oil prices and in the commodity prices is a demand-driven process, that is, coming largely, but not exclusively, from emerging Asia and is also producing a lot of consequences in the manufacturing sector. And so some prices are pushed up, while others are pushed down. If you eliminate all those prices that are pushed up and maintain in your understanding of inflation those which are pushed down, perhaps it is not fair; perhaps it is better for demand-driven change in relative prices to look at the full picture and not only at part of the picture. This of course calls for additional research \\u2013 there is a lot of research on that. Probably, what I am telling you now is an emerging consensus amongst our own constituency of central banks. \\n\\nQuestion: \\nIt is a big day for all of us. We have been waiting for a move for months, if not years. How are you feeling today? You must be nervous. Can you tell us a bit about it? It\\u2019s important. And also, could you give us a bit of a sense of how the debate was within the Governing Council? I understand it was a unanimous decision, but was it a vivid debate? What were your feelings on the debate? And one last question regarding the so-called voices: your predecessor used to say \\u201cI hear, but I do not listen\\u201d. Would you say the same? \\n\\n \\nTrichet:\\n First of all, I feel the responsibility of being the President of a college that must deliver price stability: a college that is called by a Treaty, and by 311 million people, to deliver price stability; and a college that has so far succeeded in achieving the highest level of credibility vis-\\u00e0-vis Europe and the rest of the world, as far as market participants, investors and savers are concerned. \\n\\nAs regards my own feelings, they are feelings of responsibility and also that of a very strong team spirit. The 18 members of the Governing Council are a great team. And seen from the rest of the world and from Europe, that team is credible. And I can prove it. Who would have thought that I could stand here in front of you and tell you that over the past five years we have had the same level of medium and long-term market rates \\u2013 not to speak of the short-term rates (we are lower as regards the short-term rates) \\u2013 as the best and most credible currencies. \\n\\nThe debate today was profound, deep and highly responsible. We discussed all possible arguments and exchanged views to be sure that we were taking the best decision. And that is our intimate conviction. \\n\\nQuestion: \\nI have two questions. What is the level of potential growth in Europe? This is very unclear, because last time some people thought it was 1.5%, and second, I have the impression that your strategy, as far as announcing interest rate change is concerned, has changed to become somewhat clearer and more predictable. It has never happened before that the President of the ECB has said what the Bank will do 15 days before a Governing Council meeting, or 15 days after a Council meeting where no rate move has been made. And you were reading from a speaking note; it was not just coming out of your heart. It has also never happened before that a board member has said a day before the Council meeting that it was highly probable that a move would come, as Mr Bini Smaghi said yesterday. So, is this a change of strategy or is it wanted? \\n\\n \\nTrichet:\\n First on the growth potential. We ourselves are not dictating what is the growth potential of Europe. All economists, all international institutions and national institutions are looking at it. And I will refer to what seems to me to be some kind of emerging consensus. When I take the analysis of the OECD, the IMF, the Commission, our own analysis, the private-sector analysis and so forth, I would say, as regards the medium and long-term growth potential, that the previous appreciation was that it was between 2% and 2.5%, and now there is probably a sentiment \\u2013 again, I am cautious as you see \\u2013 that we are closer to 2%: 2% plus something which is meagre, 2.1%, 2.2% perhaps; but closer to 2% than 2.5%. On a shorter-term basis, namely for next year for instance, there is also quite a large sentiment \\u2013 but, again, I am very cautious \\u2013 that perhaps we are just below 2%. 1.5% is not a figure which, to my knowledge, is applicable to the short term or medium term. It would apply rather to the much longer term \\u2013 20 or 25 years \\u2013 taking into account very poor evolution of demography and perhaps also the very negative working assumption that structural reforms are not being done. I consider it not credible because it accumulates a number of negative factors that I trust will be corrected. \\n\\nOn predictability, we were very proud to be one of the most predictable central banks of the world, perhaps I could say \\u201cex aequo\\u201d with a great sister institution \\u2013 perhaps the most predictable \\u2013 and we will continue to be highly predictable. \\n\\nQuestion:\\n \\u2026 but is this an increase in predictability \\u2026\\n\\n \\nTrichet:\\n \\u2026 no, I am not sure it is an increase in predictability It is an implementation of predictability. \\n\\nQuestion:\\n I have a question on another topic. You have just changed the rules for collateral. A-minus and better-rated government bonds will be accepted in repos. Why have you shifted so much power to the private agencies? This is my first question. And the second is: are you not concerned that this would dilute the importance of democratic decisions of elected parliaments and governments if you gave the agencies power to decide over our budgets? \\n\\n \\nTrichet:\\n First of all, it is not a new decision. It is a decision that was implemented when the euro was first introduced. And the market people \\u2013 the specialists observing what we were doing, looking at our website \\u2013 could see that there was no change. It was what we had done since the very beginning; it was embedded in our policy. It has been made more visible, but there has been no change. We are bound to treat private paper and public paper in the same fashion. And the A-minus threshold that you mentioned, again, is something which has been state of the art since the very beginning. We were told very often by parts of the economists\\u2019 community and by a lot of good advisors that we were \\u2013 and this was exactly the contrary observation \\u2013 too benign, too positive vis-\\u00e0-vis government paper, that we should practice a lot of haircuts and so forth, or practice haircuts combined with the Stability and Growth Pact implementation \\u2013 or non-implementation. We thought that this was not appropriate. We said that it was not appropriate for us to invent a new sanction that would apply for non-compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact via this collateral mechanism. We felt that we should not do that. But we mentioned also very clearly to market people that we were taking the paper at its market value, so that if the markets would assess that the paper was less credible and the spreads would augment, then the value of the paper that we would take as collateral would diminish. And then we were sticking to this appreciation by the market itself. \\n\\nQuestion:\\n Given your remarks today as well as your remarks last week before the European Parliament about the ECB not having any catching up to do, I am wondering if you could clarify something for us a little: are we supposed to see today\\u2019s move as a one-off measure for now or is it part of a broader policy shift towards a gradual removal of accommodation for the economy? \\n\\n \\nTrichet:\\n I thought I had been clear, but this is an occasion to be clear again. We have not taken any ex ante decision to embark on a series of interest rate increases. We will look at the facts and figures, make our judgement on the risks to price stability and take the decisions we will judge appropriate to deliver price stability. \\n\\nQuestion: \\nFor this question I would like to have a comment from Mr Papademos as well, if possible. In any case I would like to ask if you think your decision today would have a specific impact on the weaker economies of the European Union, especially in terms of their ability to cope with the Lisbon strategy? \\n\\n \\nPapademos:\\n We do not expect that a change in the monetary policy stance is going to have a significant effect on economic activity in the euro area as a whole. And then the extent to which there would be a specific impact in a given country depends on a variety of other factors that influence economic activity in that country as well. \\n\\n \\nTrichet:\\n As Lucas said, we look at the 311 million people and we cannot do otherwise. It would be exactly as if you would ask our friends in the US whether they are taking into account the position of Texas, of California, and so on. You see, we have a single monetary area, a single euro, and we have to make an overall judgement. And I mentioned in the introductory remarks that Lucas and I and all our colleagues were pleased, I have to say, with some of the measures that have been taken on the structural side, \\n\\nQuestion:\\n Just two small questions. One is: You characterised a 2% interest rate as historically low. Maybe you have never used the word \\u201crecord\\u201d low, but the lowest since the establishment of the Bundesbank. What words would you use to characterise a 2.25% interest rate? That is the first question. And then the second question is: for those of us who are rusty on our Latin, we all getting to know the phrase \\u201cex ante\\u201d and I just wanted to ask you \\u2013 because I think it is not a trivial point \\u2013 when you say an \\u201cex ante decision\\u201d, what precisely do you mean by that?\\n\\n \\nTrichet:\\n Ex ante means \\u201cex ante\\u201d in English and in Latin. In French, I would say \\u201ca priori\\u201d and not \\u201cex ante\\u201d, but only in French. In English it would be \\u2013 it seems to me \\u2013 \\u201cex ante\\u201d. \\n\\n2% is not the lowest, it is lower than the lowest figure attained by the Bundesbank. It is perfectly possible that 2.25 has the same characteristics!\\n\\nQuestion: \\nMr President, if I am not mistaken, the rate of contractual wage increases in the last available quarter was 2.1%. Now some economists think this is unhealthily low. You seem to be in a spirit that you would be alarmed if it was going higher. Could you give us an idea what would be a rate, or a range of rates, of wage increases that you would think in line with price stability?\\n\\n \\nTrichet:\\n No, I will not. But I will tell you \\u2013 because you are offering me the possibility of making the point \\u2013 that what we do is to cope with the risks we see. From time to time, I am told that these risks do not actually materialise. And then it is added that one should wait for the materialisation of these risks. But if a risk materialises, it is no longer a risk! It has become the figure you have in front of you, and that would be too late. So, here we are doing something that we consider to be exactly appropriate to cope with those risks and to avoid a materialisation of those risks. And this is the understanding of the global market. The global markets have understood this, if you look at the range of market information we are receiving, particularly from the bonds market, whether indexed or not.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n Mr President, could you give us an idea of what percentage the effect of the German VAT increase contributed to your inflation forecast for 2007 and \\u2013 a second question, if I may \\u2013 could you give us an idea of where you see a neutral rate, even if you are saying now that there is not ex ante decision to approach it, but which range could we think of?\\n\\n \\nTrichet:\\n I will certainly not give you a neutral rate figure. It was not done on the other side of the Atlantic either. I do not myself refer to a neutral rate. I refer to the rate which is in line with what allows us to deliver price stability and to be credible in the delivery of price stability over time. As regards your first question, I will only mention that, at the level of the staff \\u2013 and do not forget it is the staff of the Eurosystem who prepared the projections \\u2013 we have taken all information into consideration, including the information that was available in Germany, of course, but not only that on Germany, all the information available in all of the 12 economies that make up the euro area.\\n\\nQuestion: \\nMr President, I have a question on your dialogue with Eurogroup Finance Minister Juncker. At the next G7 Meeting you have to speak with one voice because foreign exchange rate policy is a divided matter that belongs to you and the ECOFIN President, Eurogroup President. What is your dialogue today to find one voice after the monetary recommendations of Jean-Claude Juncker over the last days?\\n\\n \\nTrichet: \\nAs regards monetary policy, Jean-Claude Juncker himself said it very clearly in front of the Parliament: It is our decision. It is the decision of this institution and there is no dispute on the fact that it is our decision. So, where monetary policy is at stake, there is absolutely no ambiguity. As regards the dialogue with Jean-Claude Juncker in preparation of the G7, we have never had any problem of that kind in the past, and I do not expect any such problem in the future. You know that we will be having discussions with our other friends, with members of the G7 on exchange rates. In that respect, we had in the last G7 meetings a very clear sentiment that I have signed up to myself and that was endorsed by all members, including Jean-Claude Juncker and his predecessor. And I expect that we will reach a consensus in exactly the same fashion, a consensus that will not only be a consensus amongst Europeans \\u2013 because that would obviously not be very efficient \\u2013 but a consensus with the United States, with Japan and with the other friends \\u2013 the United Kingdom and Canada \\u2013 and that we will together sign what we trust and judge to be appropriate. You will see what we will say in London, and I will of course not reveal in advance what we will say.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n Mr Trichet, just two short questions. Suddenly, a fortnight ago, we as observers were surprised by a statement in front of the banking congress. Were some members of the Governing Council surprised as well by that statement? And the second question refers to the communication in front of the first press conference in November and the press conference today: historically, you had this idea that the week before the meetings no one on the Governing Council would speak to the public about monetary policy and, suddenly, that was broken in November as well as in December. Are you going to stop that or do we have to live in a new universe of communication?\\n\\n \\nTrichet: \\nIt is absolutely clear that we have a purdah period and that if there has been such communication; it was not in line with our concept. I have no memory of anything in November, but then it was because one person did not realise that there were journalists in the room. But it is not the intention of any member of the Governing Council not to respect the purdah period, that is absolutely clear and it is important. It is a rule which is also state of the art in the constituency of central banks. \\n\\nAs regards your first question, no members of the Governing Council were surprised by what I said because I expressed the sentiment of the Governing Council. \\n\\n \\n\\nCONTACT\\n\\nEuropean Central Bank\\n\\nDirectorate General Communications\\n\\nSonnemannstrasse 20\\n\\n60314 Frankfurt am Main, Germany\\n\\n+49 69 1344 7455\\n\\nmedia@ecb.europa.eu\\n\\nReproduction is permitted provided that the source is acknowledged.\\n\\nMedia contacts\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"statement_text_clean\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 274,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, Frankfurt am Main, 5 July 2001\\nWith a transcript of the questions and answers\\nLadies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by Mr. Reynders, President of the EU Council, and Mr. Solbes from the European Commission.\\nAs usual, we conducted our\\nregular examination of monetary and economic developments\\nand analysed their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. The Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. It considers that the current monetary policy stance remains appropriate and should bring inflation back in line with price stability in the medium term. Maintaining a favourable perspective for price stability is the best contribution monetary policy can make to fostering economic growth over the long run.\\nLet me elaborate somewhat on our assessment of the information provided under the two pillars of the ECB's monetary policy strategy.\\nRegarding the first pillar, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 (adjusted for non-residents' holdings of money market fund shares/units) stood at 4.9% in the period from March to May 2001. As indicated previously, there is some evidence that M3 is currently distorted upwards by holdings of money market paper and short-term debt securities of non-euro area residents. Taking this into account, the three-month moving average of M3 in the period from March to May 2001 was broadly in line with the reference value of 4 1/2%. In addition, over recent months, the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector in the euro area has continued to moderate.\\nConcerning the second pillar, given the circumstances, it seems particularly important to recall the forward-looking nature of our assessment. At the current juncture economic developments appear to be particularly influenced by special factors. HICP inflation is still high at present, mainly reflecting past trends in energy and food prices. However, given the nature of these shocks and taking into account the present monetary policy stance, we expect them to have only a temporary effect on inflation rates. If no further unfavourable shocks occur, it is likely that annual rates of inflation will start to fall and reach rates of below 2% in 2002 - although the decrease from current levels over the months to come may be subject to some volatility. The main risk related to this outlook concerns second-round effects having an impact on wage negotiations this year and early next. As has been said on previous occasions, when looking back, the wage developments seen so far have been satisfactory, while, when looking to the future, there is ongoing concern.\\nAs has now been confirmed, overall economic growth in the euro area moderated substantially in early 2001 and both survey and confidence indicators suggest a pattern of continued growth moderation for the second quarter of the year. These developments appear to be related to the less favourable external environment as well as to the weak growth of domestic demand. The latter reflects the adverse effects on income and consumption from past increases in energy and food prices and the slowdown in investment. However, in the course of the year, domestic demand should gradually recover from adverse price effects, given the sound economic fundamentals of the euro area, previous and ongoing tax reforms and favourable financing conditions. Average real GDP growth in the euro area is therefore expected to remain broadly in line with trend potential growth in 2001 and 2002.\\nOverall, our current policy stance should ensure price stability in the medium term. Of course, we shall continue to monitor closely future developments affecting the balance of risks to price stability, including - in particular - monetary developments, real GDP growth, price-setting behaviour and wage developments.\\nAs I said earlier, at a point in time when economic developments are being affected by a number of special factors, the Governing Council would like to stress its medium-term and forward-looking perspective. Monetary policy will ensure a stance consistent with price stability over the medium term. Keeping firmly to this commitment has favourable effects on the economy as a whole. Since the start of Monetary Union, monetary policy has been successful in maintaining low inflationary expectations over the medium term. As a consequence, the euro area enjoys low long-term interest rates which are conducive to both economic growth and employment creation. A factor facilitating the maintenance of price stability will be continued wage moderation. Such moderation will help employment growth and thereby foster consumer confidence and domestic demand in the period ahead.\\nIn addition, the prospects for non-inflationary economic growth can be significantly enhanced by decisive structural reform. Delays in introducing such reforms on the basis of cyclical considerations would be at the expense of medium-term growth opportunities.\\nA medium-term perspective is also most warranted for the conduct of fiscal policies in the euro area member countries. For all euro area countries, it is of crucial importance to fulfil in a credible manner the commitments made under the Stability and Growth Pact and those laid down in the context of the stability programmes.\\nLet me now give the floor to the Vice-President, who will inform you about some other issues.\\nLet me first refer to the current discussion on the potential impact on prices of the euro cash changeover. In general, price transparency and market competition are likely to limit inflationary pressures from the cash changeover. As regards administered prices, the finance ministers forming the Eurogroup have pledged that \\\"overall, the conversion into euro of all prices, charges and fees administered by their governments will be price neutral or smoothed in favour of the consumer\\\". The Governing Council calls on governments at other levels and enterprises to follow this example set by central governments. Moreover, the ECB calls upon the public's vigilance in monitoring prices and price changes, encouraging consumer and other organisations to actively engage in this task.\\nSecond, I should like to inform you that the Governing Council has decided that euro area national central banks may\\nfrontload euro banknotes to central banks outside the euro area\\nas from 1 December 2001. This measure is aimed at contributing to a smooth cash changeover in 2002. You will find further information relating to this decision in a separate\\npress release\\nto be issued this afternoon.\\nThird, as you are aware, the Governing Council paid particular attention to the specific needs of the blind and partially sighted when agreeing on the design of euro banknotes. To that end, several features have been incorporated into both the banknotes and the coins. In order to further assist visually handicapped citizens in recognising the euro banknotes and coins, and to help them to distinguish between the various denominations, the Governing Council decided to allocate about EUR 1 million to the production of 400,000 specially designed\\ncash-testing devices.\\nThese will be made available via the network of the European Blind Union.\\nFinally, the Governing Council has adopted a Decision amending the Decision on the adoption of\\nthe Conditions of Employment for Staff of the European Central Bank.\\nThis Decision will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\\nWe are now at your disposal for questions.\",\n          \"Introductory statement to the press conference (with Q&A)\\nMario Draghi, President of the ECB,V\\u00edtor Const\\u00e2ncio, Vice-President of the ECB,Frankfurt am Main, 7 February 2013\\nLadies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today\\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council.\\nBased on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the\\nkey ECB interest rates\\nunchanged. HICP inflation rates have declined further, as anticipated, and are expected to fall below 2% in the coming months. Over the policy-relevant horizon, inflationary pressures should remain contained. The underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. Medium to longer-term inflation expectations for the euro area remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. Overall, this allows our monetary policy stance to remain accommodative. The economic weakness in the euro area is expected to prevail in the early part of 2013. In particular, necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors will continue to weigh on economic activity. Later in 2013 economic activity should gradually recover, supported by our accommodative monetary policy stance, the improvement in financial market confidence and reduced fragmentation, as well as a strengthening of global demand. In order to sustain confidence, it is essential for governments to reduce further both fiscal and structural imbalances and to proceed with financial sector restructuring.\\nWith regard to the liquidity situation of banks, counterparties have so far repaid \\u20ac140.6 billion of the \\u20ac489.2 billion obtained in the first of the two three-year longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) settled in December 2011 and March 2012. This reflects the improvement in financial market confidence. Repayments are provided for in the modalities of the three-year LTROs and are at the discretion of the counterparties, who must appropriately assess their funding situation, their ability to provide new loans to the economy and their resilience to shocks. We will closely monitor conditions in the money market and their potential impact on the stance of monetary policy, which will remain accommodative with the full allotment mode of liquidity provision.\\nLet me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the\\neconomic analysis\\n. Euro area real GDP declined by 0.1%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2012, following a contraction of 0.2% in the second quarter. Available data continue to signal further weakness in activity in the fourth quarter and at the beginning of 2013. This weakness reflects the adverse impact of low consumer and investor sentiment on domestic expenditure, as well as subdued foreign demand. However, financial market sentiment has improved and the latest survey indicators confirm earlier evidence of a stabilisation in business and consumer confidence, albeit at low levels. Later in 2013 a gradual recovery should start, with domestic demand being supported by our accommodative monetary policy stance, the improvement in financial market confidence and reduced fragmentation, and export growth benefiting from a strengthening of global demand.\\nThe risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. They relate to the possibility of weaker than expected domestic demand and exports, slow implementation of structural reforms in the euro area, as well as geopolitical issues and imbalances in major industrialised countries which could both have an impact on developments in global commodities and financial markets. These factors have the potential to dampen the ongoing improvement in confidence and thereby delay the recovery.\\nAccording to Eurostat\\u2019s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.0% in January 2013, down from 2.2% in November and December and from 2.5% in October. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates are expected to decline further to below 2% in the coming months. Over the policy-relevant horizon, in an environment of weak economic activity in the euro area and well-anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain contained.\\nRisks to the outlook for price developments continue to be seen as broadly balanced over the medium term, with upside risks relating to higher administered prices and indirect taxes, as well as higher oil prices, and downside risks stemming from weaker economic activity and, more recently, the appreciation of the euro exchange rate.\\nTurning to the\\nmonetary analysis\\n, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. The annual growth rate of M3 decreased to 3.3% in December 2012, from 3.8% in November. Shifts from overnight deposits to short-term time deposits led to a decrease in the annual rate of growth of M1, which declined to 6.2% in December, from 6.7% in November, and outflows from marketable instruments dampened overall M3 growth. A further strengthening in the deposit base of MFIs in a number of stressed countries took place in December, in combination with further capital inflows into the euro area, both of which continued to reduce fragmentation.\\nThe annual growth rate of loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained negative in December. This mainly reflected ongoing negative annual growth of loans to non-financial corporations, which was -1.3% in December after -1.5% in November. However, annual growth in MFI loans to households remained broadly unchanged at 0.7% in December. To a large extent, subdued loan dynamics reflect the current stage of the business cycle, heightened credit risk and the ongoing adjustment in the balance sheets of the financial and non-financial sectors. In line with these developments, the bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2012 confirms the weakness in credit demand and the continued effect of credit risk considerations on the tightening of credit standards. At the same time, the survey confirms the positive impact of Eurosystem measures on banks\\u2019 overall funding and liquidity situation. In particular, banks reported improvements across all funding categories in the fourth quarter.\\nIn order to ensure adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential to continue strengthening the resilience of banks where needed. Decisive steps for establishing an integrated financial framework will help to accomplish this objective. The future single supervisory mechanism (SSM) is one of the main building blocks. It is a crucial move towards re-integrating the banking system.\\nTo sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. A\\ncross-check\\nwith the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture.\\nAs regards other policy areas,\\nstructural reforms\\nand\\nfiscal adjustment\\ncan complement each other, thereby improving the outlook for job creation, economic growth and debt sustainability. Past policy action is bearing fruit, in terms of both the unwinding of existing fiscal imbalances and the reduction of current account deficits. In particular, in several countries with particular adjustment needs, contained growth in unit labour costs signals greater price competitiveness and exports are performing better. Governments should build on the progress achieved in fiscal consolidation, strengthen competition in product markets and continue with labour market reforms. This would boost the euro area\\u2019s growth potential, reduce high structural unemployment and improve the adjustment capacities of the euro area countries.\\nWe are now at your disposal for questions.\",\n          \"Introductory statement to the press conference (with Q&A)\\nMario Draghi, President of the ECB, V\\u00edtor Const\\u00e2ncio, Vice-President of the ECB,Frankfurt am Main, 3 December 2015\\nLadies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today\\u2019s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President, Mr\\u00a0Dombrovskis.\\nBased on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we today conducted a thorough assessment of the strength and persistence of the factors that are currently slowing the return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term and re-examined the degree of monetary accommodation. As a result, the Governing Council took the following decisions in the pursuit of its price stability objective:\\nFirst, as regards the\\nkey ECB interest rates\\n, we decided to lower the interest rate on the deposit facility by 10 basis points to -0.30%. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the rate on the marginal lending facility will remain unchanged at their current levels of 0.05% and 0.30% respectively.\\nSecond, as regards\\nnon-standard monetary policy measures\\n, we decided to extend the asset purchase programme (APP). The monthly purchases of \\u20ac60 billion under the APP are now intended to run until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.\\nThird, we decided to\\nreinvest the principal payments\\non the securities purchased under the APP as they mature, for as long as necessary. This will contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance. The technical details will be communicated in due time.\\nFourth, we decided to include, in the public sector purchase programme,\\neuro-denominated marketable debt instruments issued by regional and local governments located in the euro area\\nin the list of assets that are eligible for regular purchases by the respective national central banks.\\nFifth, we decided to continue conducting the main refinancing operations and three-month longer-term refinancing operations as\\nfixed rate tender procedures with full allotment\\nfor as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the last reserve maintenance period of 2017.\\nToday\\u2019s decisions were taken in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% and thereby to anchor medium-term inflation expectations. The latest staff projections incorporate the favourable financial market developments following our last monetary policy meeting. They still indicate continued downside risks to the inflation outlook and slightly weaker inflation dynamics than previously expected. This follows downward revisions in earlier projection exercises. The persistence of low inflation rates reflects sizeable economic slack weighing on domestic price pressures and headwinds from the external environment.\\nOur new measures will ensure accommodative financial conditions and further strengthen the substantial easing impact of the measures taken since June 2014, which have had significant positive effects on financing conditions, credit and the real economy. Today\\u2019s decisions also reinforce the momentum of the euro area\\u2019s economic recovery and strengthen its resilience against recent global economic shocks. The Governing Council will closely monitor the evolution in the outlook for price stability and, if warranted, is willing and able to act by using all the instruments available within its mandate in order to maintain an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation. In particular, the Governing Council recalls that the APP provides sufficient flexibility in terms of adjusting its size, composition and duration.\\nLet me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the\\neconomic analysis\\n. Euro area real GDP increased by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2015, following a rise of 0.4% in the previous quarter, most likely on account of a continued positive contribution from consumption alongside more muted developments in investment and exports. The most recent survey indicators point to ongoing real GDP growth in the final quarter of the year. Looking ahead, we expect the economic recovery to proceed. Domestic demand should be further supported by our monetary policy measures and their favourable impact on financial conditions, as well as by the earlier progress made with fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. Moreover, low oil prices should provide support for households\\u2019 real disposable income and corporate profitability and, therefore, private consumption and investment. In addition, government expenditure is likely to increase in some parts of the euro area, reflecting measures in support of refugees. However, the economic recovery in the euro area continues to be dampened by subdued growth prospects in emerging markets and moderate global trade, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms.\\nThis outlook is broadly reflected in the December 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.5% in 2015, 1.7% in 2016 and 1.9% in 2017. Compared with the September 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the prospects for real GDP growth are broadly unchanged.\\nThe risks to the euro area growth outlook relate in particular to the heightened uncertainties regarding developments in the global economy as well as to broader geopolitical risks. These risks have the potential to weigh on global growth and foreign demand for euro area exports and on confidence more widely.\\nAccording to Eurostat\\u2019s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 0.1% in November 2015, unchanged from October but lower than expected. This reflected somewhat weaker price increases in services and industrial goods, mainly compensated for by a less negative contribution from energy prices. On the basis of the information available and current oil futures prices, annual HICP inflation rates are expected to rise at the turn of the year, mainly on account of base effects associated with the fall in oil prices in late 2014. During 2016 and 2017, inflation rates are foreseen to pick up further, supported by our previous monetary policy measures \\u2013 and supplemented by those announced today \\u2013 the expected economic recovery, and the pass-through of past declines in the euro exchange rate. The Governing Council will closely monitor the evolution of inflation rates over the period ahead.\\nThis broad pattern is also reflected in the December 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 0.1% in 2015, 1.0% in 2016 and 1.6% in 2017. In comparison with the September 2015 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for HICP inflation has been revised down slightly.\\nTurning to the\\nmonetary analysis\\n, recent data confirm solid growth in broad money (M3), with the annual rate of growth of M3 increasing to 5.3% in October 2015 from 4.9% in September. Annual growth in M3 continues to be mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 growing at an annual rate of 11.8% in October, after 11.7% in September.\\nLoan dynamics continued the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 0.6% in October, up from 0.1% in September. Despite these improvements, developments in loans to enterprises continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 1.2% in October, compared with 1.1% in September. Overall, the monetary policy measures in place since June 2014 have clearly improved borrowing conditions for both firms and households and credit flows across the euro area.\\nTo sum up, a\\ncross-check\\nof the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need for further monetary stimulus in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%.\\nMonetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance supports economic activity. However, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively. Given continued high structural unemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area, the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective structural policies. In particular, actions to improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, are vital to increase productive investment, boost job creation and raise productivity. The swift and effective implementation of\\nstructural reforms\\n, in an environment of accommodative monetary policy, will not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but will also raise expectations of permanently higher incomes and accelerate the beneficial effects of reforms, thereby making the euro area more resilient to global shocks.\\nFiscal policies\\nshould support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the European Union. Full and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact is crucial for confidence in our fiscal framework. At the same time, all countries should strive for a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies.\\nWe are now at your disposal for questions.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"qa_text_clean\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 273,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Question (translation):\\nTwo questions, if you will allow. During the last quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2001 you underestimated the slowdown in the United States and its impact on the euro zone, just as the governments did. Now, today, you seem to be very optimistic. You talk of a growth potential which will be fulfilled in 2001 and 2002. What facts and what data allow you to be so optimistic about this? After all, in the United States there are more and more alarm signals. That is my first question. Second question. The Ifo Institut published a rather interesting study analysing the reasons for the euro's weakness and it explained that if the euro is weak it is because Deutsche Mark are being sold in great quantities in eastern European countries and in Russia before the changeover to the euro. Their being sold is of course strengthening the dollar. Do you agree with this analysis?\\nDuisenberg:\\nIt may have struck you that I used the same language today as I used at the last press conference, namely that output growth is expected to be broadly in line with the trend potential growth. That is the best estimate that we have. And it is true that we already had to lower our expectations or forecasts some time ago, as is also reflected in the projections that were published in our last Monthly Bulletin. I recognise that the selling of Deutsche Mark circulating in particular in central and eastern Europe and in Russia may partly have an impact on the exchange rate. However, our estimates are that the sale of these Deutsche Mark to a very large extent takes the form of converting cash into bank deposits, and these can be euro area-denominated deposits. An additional factor is that we are seeing, in particular, a drastic decline in the circulation of large-denomination Deutsche Mark (and Guilder) banknotes coming possibly from the black economy. And we do not know, by definition of course, where they are. But we note that the circulation of these large-denomination notes is taking place. What we do not know is what that money is used for. Is it used to buy other currencies? Is it used to buy real estate? Is it used to buy other types of assets? That, by definition, we do not know. But then I would like to point out that the monetary impact of all this is very limited indeed. If you realise that notes in circulation represent about 6% - and no more - of the M3 figure, then you will also realise that part of that 6%, and really only a small part of those banknotes in circulation, are circulating outside the euro area. And again, part of that small part may then be converted into other assets, which makes the conclusion justified that the monetary impact of these moves in the run-up to the cash changeover is very limited indeed, if not negligible. We cannot deny that it may have some impact on the exchange rate as well.\\nQuestion (translation):\\nMr. Duisenberg, I wanted to ask how you would explain the weakness of the euro on the exchange rate market? Second question. Are you going to be present at the Eurogroup meeting on Monday in Brussels? And third question. Do you consider the ECB to be an institution which is ready to have a prime minister, or maybe an ex-prime minister, as its president?\\nDuisenberg:\\nI cannot explain fully, as I have said on many occasions, the level of the euro at any particular moment. The tendency to stay in the neighbourhood of 84, 85, 86 cent against the dollar has already lasted three to four months. And all the factors that we have mentioned in the past explaining the depreciation of the euro now seem to have reversed. Yet this has not as yet had an impact on the exchange rate of the euro. But we remain convinced that the euro - and this is not an empty slogan - does indeed have a strong potential to appreciate. That is the considered conviction of the Governing Council.\\nAs to the second question, I will be present at the Eurogroup meeting.\\nAs for your last question I can only answer that the ECB is ready to have a former minister, namely a former finance minister, as its president, who is sitting right here, right now.\\nQuestion:\\nMr. President, are you worried that the various inflation rates within the EU Member States are drifting apart rather than getting closer together? The range now lies, if I am correctly informed, between 2.5% in France and up to 5.4% in the Netherlands. Is that range still acceptable to the ECB or is this some sort of warning sign?\\nDuisenberg:\\nWell, the range as such is not that important. The fact that there are inflation differentials between the various regions in the euro area is - as we have explained many times, and, I am almost inclined to say - normal. These differentials will disappear and re-emerge in the future owing to different stages of development in the various countries. The fact that in the Netherlands, and fortunately to a lesser extent in Ireland, inflation has reached the figures they have, is in itself a cause for concern, particularly for the Dutch and the Irish authorities; and, to the extent that they could have spillover effects on other countries, it could also be a concern for us and the Governing Council. That is one reason why we put so much emphasis, even today, on the absolute need for moderate wage negotiations or wage moderation in the negotiating period which lies ahead.\\nQuestion:\\nIn recent months, your communication policy has been criticised by a number of observers and most recently by the OECD which has suggested that there are perhaps too many press conferences and that formal transparency is not effective transparency. Is that a fair criticism? If I could add another related question: you and Mr. Reynders have had a lot of dialogue outside of the formal meetings. Was his presence constructive and have you managed to improve the dialogue between you and the Belgian Minister of Finance?\\nDuisenberg:\\nAre there too many press conferences? We are faced with the dilemma of, on the one hand, being as open and transparent as possible, and on the other hand, with what we would see were we to have fewer press conferences. I doubt whether we would also see less speculation and guesswork in your circles. We might even see more of this were we to have fewer press conferences. Therefore, next year, it is also our intention to stick to the same schedule of one press conference per month. The presence of the President of the EU Council has certainly helped to improve the dialogue, which we have entered into so often already, and which we again had today. But it is a dialogue, I hasten to add, between the Eurogroup and the Governing Council of the ECB as such, for which I am normally the spokesmen. However, there are occasions when I am not the spokesman, but there are equally qualified colleagues on the Governing Council who can engage in that dialogue in the same way as I do. However, I have noted with satisfaction that the Belgian Minister of Finance, in his capacity as the President of the Eurogroup and now the President of the EU Council, has already attended three out of the first fourteen meetings of the Governing Council, to each of which he has been invited.\\nQuestion:\\nMr Noyer, you mentioned that the Governing Council of the ECB took a decision on the new conditions of employment, but you did not say what it was all about. Could you please tell us?\\nNoyer:\\nIt is on a number of small issues, I mainly wanted to announce that in accordance with our policy of transparency, but there was nothing really that important that I needed to flag. It concerns, for instance, the updating of the internal rules for the prohibition of insider trading, which is normal corporate governance which all central banks and commercial banks in the world have to undertake. Consequently, we have improved the system and everything will be made known and published in detail, but that was the most prominent part of the change.\\nQuestion:\\nMr. Duisenberg, could you tell us how you react when you read reports that American officials urge the ECB to do more to help global growth? And that they would allow - or would want - the dollar to go higher over the longer term? And the second question: do you think there will be any effects on Euroland from the 275 basis points of Fed easing so far to date and, if so, when will we start seeing an effect here?\\nDuisenberg:\\nWell, I believe that you should address those questions to the American authorities. I do not comment on the American monetary or fiscal policy in the context of global growth, and that means I also do not listen to advice I get from the outside on our monetary policy. Our monetary policy is clearly based on the well-known two-pillar strategy; that is decisive, and it is aimed primarily at maintaining price stability. Indeed, this is our primary aim and, as the Treaty says, only if there is no \\\"prejudice to the objective of price stability\\\", we do take into account the other general aims of the European Community, which are to maximise output growth and employment.\\nQuestion:\\nSome countries like Italy and Germany say that they will only reach their budget balance by 2006 and so beyond their nominal targets. Are you worried about this and did you discuss the issue today with Mr. Reynders and Mr. Solbes?\\nDuisenberg:\\nThe issue was mentioned today. We are concerned that the current negative environment might reduce the impetus in various countries to reach the goals to which they have agreed in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact. And we do see some slippage in the determination to reach the goal of a balanced budget or even a small surplus. That is to say, we see some slippage in some countries in the determination to get there. That is a concern we raised and which I will raise again in our dialogue with the Eurogroup.\\nQuestion:\\nPresident Duisenberg, two questions: on balance, how would you say that the risks to price stability balance out? And, second: how do you explain the fact that two days before an ECB meeting you go to the European Parliament and you say very clearly that there are no new data in the past two weeks that would make us change our assessment on interest rates, and still - after you say something like that - a quarter or some 35% of market participants think that there is a good chance you are going to do something at this meeting?\\nDuisenberg:\\nWell I thought that I could not be clearer than that, but perhaps I should repeat what I said two days ago. I said the same thing as I said at this press conference, namely that our monetary policy stance seems appropriate in the current circumstances. I repeat today that the current monetary policy stance remains appropriate in the judgement of the Governing Council and should bring inflation back in line with price stability in the medium term. And this current monetary policy stance remains appropriate, in the opinion of the Governing Council, for some time to come. I cannot be clearer than that, I believe.\\nQuestion:\\nMr. Duisenberg, in your speech in Strasbourg earlier this week, and again today, you said that you are looking - and you stressed this in particular - at developments in money supply, real GDP growth, price-setting behaviour and wage developments. Now, the current slowdown in economic growth would suggest that there are decreasing risks to price stability in the medium term in all four areas. Why then did you decide today to leave the interest rates unchanged? You claim to have a forward-looking strategy. Now, is this really forward-looking? And secondly, perhaps you will be...\\nDuisenberg:\\nMay I first answer this question? Our forward-looking strategy and our analysis indicates to us that it is likely that inflation will only come down to under 2% - which is our goal - in the course of next year. But then only just. And that makes us say, if we look one year or a year and a half ahead, that this forecast or expectation is based on the current monetary policy stance. So, if we were to change that in the direction in which you suggest, we would in all likelihood not reach that goal. And that is the reason why we did not cut interest rates and it is the reason why we regard our current monetary policy stance as appropriate, as I said to Mr. Sims, for some time to come.\\nQuestion:\\nAnd now a second question. I think you will be celebrating your 66th birthday next week, if that is correct. Now, do you think this will have any impact on your career plans at the ECB?\\nDuisenberg:\\nNo. In particular because I will be celebrating it in the meeting of the Eurogroup.\\nQuestion:\\nMr. Duisenberg, again in your speech two days ago you seemed to have signalled today's decision. At least that is what many market watchers have been saying. Would you say that you have taken the criticism that your 10 May decision met with into account? And can we count in the future on clearer signals from the ECB on future rate decisions?\\nDuisenberg:\\nWell, we have always maintained that we did not want to surprise markets. But sometimes a surprise is unavoidable. But it is not our policy to surprise markets. And I believe that in my statement of two days ago and in today's statement, which is basically a statement by the Governing Council, I have been as open and transparent and forward-looking as I possibly can be.\\nQuestion:\\nYes, thank you. And a short second question on the Stability Pact. Many countries might not meet the goals contained in the Pact or have been urging that it should be a topic at the next Eurogroup meeting. So how do you see that in your optimism on euro area growth, because you have been pretty optimistic about euro zone growth? Is this not a clear signal that governments are facing difficulties as a result of the global slowdown?\\nDuisenberg:\\nWell, in so far as the goals are not being met for cyclical reasons - so that, in a way, automatic stabilisers are doing their work - we have no reason to be concerned. But it will be a reason for concern if structural developments, also in public deficits, do not work at the same pace or in the same way towards reaching the goals of the Stability and Growth Pact in a proper manner.\\nQuestion (translation):\\nMr. Duisenberg, on Saturday the G8 Finance Ministers are meeting in Rome. Now, that is a meeting without monetary policy spokespersons, but of course Mr. O'Neill, the US Secretary of the Treasury, \\\"Mr. Dollar\\\", will be there as well. Have you started to make any indirect contact with these G7 Finance Ministers in view of the meeting in Rome so that a consensus could be achieved if there were to be any questions on the euro or on the global economy, since the global economy is supposed to be one of the main topics at that meeting?\\nDuisenberg:\\nThe meeting in Rome, as I understand it, is meant as a preparatory meeting for the summit of the G8 Prime Ministers and Presidents. And for that particular preparatory meeting, no central banker will be present or has been invited, and that also means that I have made no contacts of the kind that you suggest. I have adequate contacts with the central banks of the G7 partners, including Mr. Greenspan.\\nQuestion:\\nI still have two questions left. You said, I think, last time, that you agreed with the growth projections of most international institutions. But these projections are based on the assumption that you cut rates by half a percentage point. Do your projections also include this detail? Second, there is an aspect of the data that you did not comment upon, and that is the significant decrease in inflation in Germany and Italy. May inflation come down more quickly?\\nDuisenberg:\\nIn our projections the monetary policy stance or the level of interest rates is a so-called exogenous variable, so we do not assume any change, strictly for - I am almost inclined to say - \\\"scientific reasons\\\". We had a high figure in May. We expect the June figure already to show a decline from that level. But as I have said on various occasions, mainly because of the base effects of the development twelve months ago which, month after month, will fall out of the figures, the road to the level under 2% may be a bumpy one. There may be months in which inflation stabilises or there may even be months in which it shows a further rise. But there will be more months in which it shows a decline. And the decline we expect for the month of June will already be, in our expectation, and according to first indications, not insubstantial, or will be considerable.\\nQuestion:\\nThe European Commission is discussing plans to regulate the fees that banks levy on transfers within the euro area that are non-domestic. Do you support these plans?\\nDuisenberg:\\nWe take a neutral position on this. We support the aim, namely that over time we hope that the costs of transferring money abroad or domestically will be the same. And we urge banks to work in that direction. Now this process is being strengthened by the current consideration of the Commission to issue a regulation to this effect, thereby forcing the private sector to act in a certain way. We have also considered whether we should do the same, but we think that this would run counter to our mandate to act in a market-oriented way and to let the market do its work freely.\\nCONTACT\\nEuropean Central Bank\\nDirectorate General Communications\\nSonnemannstrasse 20\\n60314 Frankfurt am Main, Germany\\n+49 69 1344 7455\\nmedia@ecb.europa.eu\\nReproduction is permitted provided that the source is acknowledged.\\nMedia contacts\",\n          \"Question:\\nFirst of all, a bit of housekeeping: were other options discussed apart from the 50 basis point cut?\\nSecondly, on the issue of quantitative easing, there has been a lot of discussion about quantitative easing not only with the ECB, of course, but with the ECB sparked by remarks by Axel Weber and Christian Noyer referring to commercial paper programmes, and that the ECB could embark on buying commercial papers. Was that discussed, has that been an issue?\\nAnd in that context, thirdly, with that, how concerned are you at the ECB that the ECB\\u2019s balance sheet is getting longer and longer and, in fact, there has been a great deal of quantitative easing already?\\nTrichet:\\nOn your first question, we had, as always, an in-depth discussion on the present situation, on all the observations, which were made, on all figures, on staff projections and on the appropriate policy decision in the present circumstances. After this thorough discussion we concluded by a consensus on the decision which we took. I have just mentioned what we did as regards interest rates. I emphasise the fact that we decided to diminish our main refinancing operation rate by 50 basis points. We also decided not to change the width of the corridor, which is, between the deposit facility and the main refinancing rate, a full percentage point. So, we decided today to put our deposit facility at the level of 0.50%, which is very, very low. This decision to put our deposit facility at that level - taking into account the fact that the unlimited supply of liquidity is driving the overnight rate quite close to the deposit facility - is of great importance. We also decided today, which will be elaborated in a press release that you will have immediately after this press conference, to continue the fixed rate tender procedure with full allotment for all main refinancing operations, special-term refinancing operations and supplementary and regular longer-term refinancing operations for as long as needed and in any case beyond the end of 2009. And we have decided to continue with the current frequency and maturity profile of the supplementary longer-term refinancing operations and special-term refinancing operations for as long as needed and in any case beyond the end of 2009. These are the decisions which we have taken today.\\nAs regards your second question on quantitative easing or non-standard measures \\u2013 this would be the way I would describe these measures \\u2013 as you have underlined yourself, we are already using non-standard measures. I think you were absolutely right to say that. With the very substantial enlargement of the eligibility of our collateral, and that in combination with the supply of liquidity on an unlimited basis which has been decided by the Governing Council, we are using non-standard measures, which have had important consequences. I mentioned one of the consequences as regards the positioning of the EONIA rate. Another consequence is that our own balance sheet has augmented substantially, and, if you wish to have an order of magnitude we have an augmentation of the risk that we are taking ourselves in our own balance sheet since the start of the turbulences in August 2007, which is of the order of magnitude of 600 billion euro, of the order of magnitude of 800 billion dollars. This represents a little bit more than 6% of the GDP of the euro area, so this is substantial. As regards further non-standard measures, on top of the two measures I have mentioned, on top of what we have decided today \\u2013 to say that we would continue as long as needed and beyond the end of the year \\u2013 we are discussing and studying possible new non-standard measures. I will not elaborate on that; we had absolutely no pre-commitment to any particular non-standard measure. I don\\u2019t exclude anything. I will give you a rendezvous when, if and when, we decide. Then I would be happy to explain what we have decided. Again, we are studying possible additional non-standard measures.\\nQuestion\\n:\\nWith the main refinancing rate at 1.5% do you think you are getting close to the limit? Last time you said you considered 0% rates inappropriate. Do you still think so?\\nAnd my second question would be relating to potential non-conventional measures you may embark on in the future. Some of the non-conventional measures used by other central banks very much depend on the cooperation and indemnity of their treasuries, like the Bank of England or the Fed depend on their finance ministries to provide indemnity for any sort of default on commercial papers or anything else. So in the absence of a single European treasury, have you started discussions or pushed for discussions with various finance ministers or at the Eurogroup level to come to some sort of conclusion? I believe Mr Juncker was at the meeting today, was that raised at any level? Or was it raised at some sort of seminar or anything else?\\nTrichet:\\nAs regards your first question, I confirm what I have already said: we see a number of drawbacks associated with a zero rate level. As regards the present level of the main refinancing operations, we did not decide ex-ante that this was the lowest point that we could attain. Further decisions will depend on facts, figures and judgement of the Governing Council.\\nAs regards your second question on the non-standard measures, there is no pre-commitment for any kind of non-standard measure. I exclude nothing. It would be the decision of the Governing Council and we are looking at it. At this stage there has been no discussion with executive branches as regards any help or any guarantees or any support that could be given. And it is not an avenue which fits necessarily correctly with our own framework. We did not ask for any kind of help when we engaged in this very important consequence of the non-standard measures, namely the increase in the size of our overall balance sheet. That being said, if we exclude nothing, there is nothing that would substantiate such an avenue at this stage.\\nQuestion:\\nI have a couple of questions. You have just said you are studying the implementation of non-standard measures. Does that mean you are studying the process by which you might implement them or you are studying the need for them?\\nSecondly, I\\u2019m not an economist and maybe I\\u2019m a little bit confused. You say in the statement \\u201cafter today\\u2019s decision we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term\\u201d. If I did the maths right, in 2010 the mid-point is 1% and both 0.6 and 1.4 are well below your definition of price stability, so what am I missing?\\nAnd my last question, you also said today\\u2019s decision was a consensual decision \\u2013 could you give us a little bit more detail on that, what were the other options discussed?\\nTrichet:\\nOn the non-standard measures, we are discussing of course both the need and the process. And any decision would suppose that we see the need and that we agree on the process.\\nOn price stability, we have the staff projections \\u2013 although we do not ourselves underwrite the staff projections, they are the judgement of the staff. Let me mention just one point among many others: the present methodology is based upon existing market interest rates, the observation of the yield curve and the evolution of market interest rates. It is part of a methodology that is very much an agreed methodology, generally considered to be state of the art. Before the methodology just mentioned, we had another methodology which used the working assumption that you take the interest rates where they are and they do not change: Interest rate policy was unchanged in the previous methodology. According to various models of the euro area economy if our staff would still use the previous methodology, the projections would display substantially more growth and significantly more inflation in the euro area economy. And if I take the level of interest rates that we have decided today \\u2013 not the interest rates which existed at the moment of the projections \\u2013 then the impact would be even higher in terms of growth and inflation. Our decision today takes into account precisely the fact that we are not passive ourselves, and we use all information available to make our judgments. So we trust, as I said on behalf of the Governing Council, that with today\\u2019s decision we are ensuring price stability over the medium term.\\nRegarding your third question, I will confirm that there was a consensus, after a very in-depth discussion as we are in a very multi-dimensional, complex and uncertain world.\\nQuestion:\\nI am sure markets are going to price in further cuts in the ECB interest rates in the coming months. Would you want to say anything to discourage them, or does your statement that you put in today saying that after today\\u2019s decision we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term mean that, if events unfold as set out in your base line scenario, there would be no need for any further interest rate cuts?\\nAnd, secondly, there are a lot of issues around at the moment, but, just to focus on one or two: if we talked about classic quantitative easing in the true sense of the form that the Bank of England has announced today, would you imagine such a programme being either effective or practical in the context of the eurozone? I am not asking if you are going to do it, but given that economists seem to argue that quantitative easing does work do you think they are correct?\\nAnd third, if I might just ask you to comment on the situation in eastern European economies, and specifically the role that the European Central Bank might take in the future. What would your message be to politicians from some of those countries who are suggesting the ECB could do more, for instance by accepting collateral in assets from some of the local currencies?\\nTrichet\\n: On the first question, as I said, we did not decide ex-ante that we were at the lowest level. If justified by facts and figures, if some of the risks that I mentioned are materialising, I clearly won\\u2019t rule out the main policy rate being changed, indeed going down. That is clear. I will also mention the fact that, as regards the interest rate of the deposit facility the present level, which is 0.5%, is already a very, very low rate. These are the two comments I will make in response to your first question.\\nOn your second question, again, we are reflecting on what is likely to be done. You know that we are in a different situation in comparison with other sister institutions over the Channel or over the Atlantic. We do not have the same financial system in front of us. From the outset, we have been extraordinarily forthcoming in comparison with the other central banks as regards collateral. We have even enlarged the list of eligible collateral. The commercial banks are playing a much more important role in the euro area than it is the case in the United States in particular, but perhaps also in the United Kingdom. So it is not surprising that we have concentrated our attention on commercial banks and on being as forthcoming as possible as regards this channel. On top of the openness to the eligibility of collateral, you will remember that we were the first to go for longer-term refinancing. We are engaging in this unlimited supply of liquidity on a longer-term basis, and today we have taken a new very important decision to pursue this concept of unlimited refinancing for as long as needed and at least beyond the end of the year. All this shows that, as regards non-standard measures, we are concentrating very much on what fits the very structure of the euro area. That being said, we do not feel that we should exclude other operations. At this stage I would prefer to qualify them \\u2013 and this is also the way Ben Bernanke is qualifying such operations \\u2013 more as credit easing than quantitative easing. Again, in terms of quantity, we already have a very significant level of non-standard quantitative risk-taking that is very visible.\\nIn response to your final question on eastern Europe at this stage our position would be that it is extremely important that we do not change any frameworks. We have established rules concerning membership of ERM II or the euro. And sticking to the rules as they are is very important for the stability of the European Union as a whole. It is not good to suggest that some are in such a weak situation that you would amend the rules for the sake of that situation. I feel that it is important to stick to the present framework as it is.\\nQuestion:\\nMr Trichet, two questions, please, one is: Could you again elaborate a bit more on your or the ECB\\u2019s problems with zero interest rate policy; the arguments which would prevent the ECB from lowering the main refinancing rate to zero.\\nAnd secondly, another question on the non-standard measures: If you cannot tell us what measures the Council would prefer at the moment, could you at least give us a sort of time frame for when a decision on this might take place. Or do you think you have unlimited time to decide when to pursue those non-standard measures, because time is a bit short at the moment, is it not?\\nTrichet:\\nOn your first question, time is short and that is why we are taking important decisions. We have taken important decisions in the past few months and we have taken important decisions today with commitments that go beyond the end of the year.\\nAs regards your second question on non-standard measures, as I said we are in discussions. I am not ruling anything out. We are not pre-committed to anything. When the time comes, you will know what we have decided. And I shall give you regular updates at our press briefings, but I do not pre-commit to any particular time. In any case, we have proved that we have been able to take decisions at any time when necessary including in exceptional unforeseen circumstances. And, as I have repeatedly said today, uncertainty is the mark of the time. With regard to why we think that zero interest rates would be very inconvenient, I will not elaborate any further. It is clearly an assessment that we have made.\\nQuestion:\\nJust to follow up on your outlook for price stability which goes below 2% next year. How high would you say is the risk of deflation in the euro area?\\nAnd my second question is: you know that there are also preparations in the euro area by politicians on how to assist countries in trouble within the euro area, not eastern Europe. I was wondering whether you would say you support these preparations or would you say that this goes too far and violates the Treaty?\\nTrichet:\\nOn your first question, we are looking very carefully and constantly at the possible risk of deflation \\u2013 as the OECD and the IMF are doing. The conclusion of the international institutions in general is that such risks are very minimal in our case. And one of the reasons why they are very minimal is that, to substantiate deflation, not only inflation on the basis of the CPI observed during a sufficiently long period of time must be negative but must it must also drive inflation expectations themselves to be negative, so that you have the downward spiral that characterises deflation. In our case, thanks to our definition of price stability and thanks to the very clear understanding by economic agents such as seen via the Survey of Professional Forecasters, since the introduction of the euro we have had quite a remarkable anchoring of inflation expectations. And when you look at the medium-term inflation expectations, whether they are extracted from surveys or whether they are extracted from the financial markets, on a medium-term basis they are very well-anchored. We must take care of that, it is not something which can be taken for granted eternally, but it helps us considerably in circumstances in which there are significant inflationary risks. We proved that we were able to weather periods which were very demanding in times of upside risks for inflation. It helps us also very much to weather periods in which, on the contrary, there might be downward pressure on inflation. So no, there is no substantiation of any significant risk of deflation and we are considerably helped by our definition of price stability and by the anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations.\\nAs regards your second question on the issue of members of the euro area that could be in extreme difficulty, first of all the euro area is an area where you have considerable automatic help through the very existence of the single currency itself. For instance the balance of payment deficit, if any, is financed automatically by virtue of belonging to the euro area. Let us not forget that. I say regularly when I am asked more direct questions that I do not comment on absurd hypotheses. I have confidence in the capacity of the governments of the euro area, in line with their own pre-eminent responsibility, to convince their own people and the markets that they are going in the right direction and that they are credible as regards the medium- to long-term path for sound fiscal policies that I mentioned on behalf of the Governing Council in the introductory remarks.\\nQuestion:\\nThree questions Mr Trichet. First of all you have a statement in here where you speak about how it has become clear that key ECB interest rates are being passed through the monetary transmission mechanism. Should we understand that as an argument against additional non-standard measures that so to speak the mechanisms are returning to their previous functioning?\\nA second question regarding the rules you apply to entering the euro zone. Those of us within this room know you are very attached to the Treaty but you do have some flexibility on how you define the best performing three members of the euro zone in calculating the inflation target. At this point that formula seems a bit odd, because it would suggest that countries need to deflate in order to meet criteria, which I am sure you do not want them to do. Have you given any thought in this direction to whether this is still appropriate going forward?\\nAnd for my third question, I would like to hear your thoughts on what you feel western Europe\\u2019s responsibilities are to the new EU Member States that joined in 2004. There is a situation of mutual dependence there in many ways, it is obviously not standard procedure to \\u201dso to speak\\u201d grab your neighbours under the arms in difficult times in the EU, but these are not normal times. What are your thoughts on that?\\nTrichet:\\nOn your first question we mentioned that the pass-through was functioning in a way which was not significantly hampered. That is the description we are using. It is true that when we look at the functioning of our money market and the impact that we have through our policy decisions on the EURIBOR market interest rates, including three-month interest rates for instance, we have observed that the functioning of the money market and the pass-through of these monetary policy decisions was not significantly hampered. This is not to say that we exclude ex-ante additional non-standard measures, because I said that if it functions quite well in our judgement, despite the acute tensions that we have to cope with it is precisely because we have taken non-standard measures. Again, to be clear on the response to your question, we would not exclude other non-standard measures.\\nOn your second question at this stage we are in agreement with the European Commission and with the governments as a group in considering that it is not appropriate to reflect on transforming or loosening the criteria. We do not think that it would help anybody at this stage, neither the countries concerned nor the euro area itself.\\nOn the third point, I would make the following comments. You mention \\u201cwestern Europe\\u201d so your question is independent of belonging or not to the euro area. You assume it is possible to make a distinction between the western part of Europe and the eastern part of Europe, which I do not like since we are all on exactly the same footing and the only pertinent differences for me are that some are members of the euro area, others are members of ERM II, others are members of the European Union without being members of the euro area or ERM II and others are out of the European Union itself. And one could also say that you have candidate countries and non-candidate countries. So these are the pertinent distinctions that you can make between the various countries. The European countries in general themselves, and particularly the eastern and central European countries, are very keen on saying that they exist in their own right and that they have their own economic and financial features and characteristics. Some of them would say that they are in a situation which is difficult and would ask for help, while others would say that they are in a situation which is solid and strong and resilient and they should not all be confused. If and when particular countries might have major difficulties, it is always possible, as has been proved in several cases, that there is help available from the European Union itself and from the European Commission and which is backed by governments. There is additional help, which can be given on a bilateral basis, as has been the case for Latvia for instance. There is also help which can come from international institutions, such when the IMF is involved. We ourselves, as we have done for some countries, can have repo agreements that would also be helpful in those circumstances. But that is for those countries that have an exceptional difficulty and that are calling for help to finance a recovery programme that is convincing. But we are all on the same continent and we must all care for our own resilience, because the resilience of the euro area itself is very important for all our partners. Our first duty is to understand that we are all interdependent and that it is very important that we continue to be \\u201cgood clients\\u201d for the eastern and central European countries that are exporting to the euro area.\\nQuestion:\\nYou said you did not decide that you are at the lowest level when it comes to the refinancing rate, yet you see drawbacks to zero rates. What does that mean? When it comes to the floor, where do you see it?\\nTrichet:\\nI will not comment more on that.\\nQuestion:\\nOkay, if I could then ask you, could you tell us about the ECB\\u2019s accounts? Were they in surplus last year? How much did the eurozone central banks earn on liquidity operations, and were there any write-downs or losses associated with holding back collateral?\\nTrichet:\\nThat is an excellent question, because I wanted to say a word on that. So, I would first mention the European Central Bank itself. We approved today the audited annual accounts of the ECB for the year ending 31 December 2008. At the end of this press conference you will have the press release. We had a surplus in 2008 of \\u20ac2.661 billion, which compares with a surplus of \\u20ac286 million in 2007 that reflected very much the effects of the euro\\u2019s appreciation against the US dollar and, to a lesser extent, the Japanese yen. So again we had a surplus of approximately \\u20ac2.7 billion in 2008. As regards the risk exposure of the ECB, based upon our assessment, an amount of \\u20ac1.339 billion was transferred from this surplus to the provision that we are making against foreign exchange risk, interest rate and gold price risks. So we declared a net result of \\u20ac1.322 billion. The provision would be used to cover possible losses arising from the risks that I mentioned. Today we have decided to distribute the remaining \\u20ac116 million, because we had already transferred to the national central banks the bulk of the net result, namely \\u20ac1.2 billion. You will have all the details in a press release after the press conference.\\nNow, I would like to refer to the Eurosystem monetary policy operations in 2008, not only at the level of the ECB, but at the level of the Eurosystem as a whole. The income from monetary policy operations is expected to amount to around \\u20ac28.7 billion in 2008, which is superior to what we had observed in 2007 for Eurosystem income from monetary operations. In 2007 we had \\u20ac23.2 billion. If I now take the aggregate net result of the Eurosystem national central banks, including the distribution of the net result that the ECB has been distributed to the NCBs and which goes onto their own balance sheet, then this net result is estimated to be approximately \\u20ac16.8 billion for 2008. The year before, the aggregate net result was \\u20ac15.2 billion. Again this information will be detailed in a press release, which will be available after the press conference. In the autumn of 2008 we had five counterparties that defaulted on refinancing operations undertaken by the Eurosystem, namely Lehman Brothers Bankhaus AG, three subsidiaries of Icelandic banks, and Indover NL. The total nominal value of the Eurosystem\\u2019s claims on these credit institutions amounted to some \\u20ac10.3 billion at the end of 2008. We have looked at this, and the decision we have taken is that any shortfall, if it were to materialise, on the amount of claims that we have, should eventually be shared in full by the Eurosystem NCBs in accordance with Article 32.4 of the Statute of the ESCB, in proportion to the prevailing ECB capital key shares of these NCBs in 2008. As a matter of prudence, we also decided at the level of the Governing Council, that the NCBs should establish their respective shares of an appropriate total provision in their annual accounts for 2008 as a buffer against possible risks arising for the monetary policy operations. The size of the total provision at the level of the Eurosystem as a whole will amount to \\u20ac5.7 billion. The net figures I gave you \\u2013 for the level of the net result of the Eurosystem - namely approximately \\u20ac16.8 billion is calculated after this provisioning. Exactly the same applies to the ECB. The ECB has made provisions and the net result we have distributed to the national central banks was after our provision. To give you an idea of the order of magnitude of our provisioning, when I pile up all the provisioning we have made in the ECB \\u2013 I am speaking of the ECB alone, and not of the Eurosystem \\u2013 that it is now around \\u20ac4 billion. It is the total provisioning we have made in order to face up to potential risks.\\nQuestion:\\nI just wanted to pick up on your unprompted remarks, I think you made them twice, about the deposit rate, that you decided to keep the corridor at 100 basis points. Can we assume - is it right to interpret it so - that you are actively considering narrowing the corridor again, and that you may actually do that before you embark on any other non-conventional measures? And also, if you are saying that 1.5% is not the limit, could we see a rate cut as soon as next month?\\nTrichet:\\nAgain, we will do whatever is necessary and I will not comment more on future decisions. I said that we had not decided ex-ante that we are at the lowest point as regards the main refinancing operation interest rate. I also mentioned that at 0.5% the deposit interest rate was at a very, very low level, also taking into account that the unlimited supply of liquidity which we operate, and are bound to operate for a long period of time, is something which pushes down the EONIA, not far away from the level of this deposit facility interest rate. That is the only remark I make, but you, of course, took it rightly so.\\nQuestion:\\nYou say you are ruling out no possible measures that you might take, these unorthodox measures, but your hands must be tied to some degree by your own charter. Are there certain things that you can rule out at this point, perhaps with regard to buying commercial paper? You are not the Federal Reserve; you are not the Bank of England. To what extent are your hands tied?\\nTrichet:\\nOur hands are not tied at all. We will do whatever we judge appropriate, taking into account the situation. We are not exactly in the same situation as the United States or the United Kingdom, and everybody knows that. So we have to optimise what we do. As regards the set of non-standard measures, I have already said that we have already adopted a large number of non-standard measures, and I can elaborate more on that. We will do what we judge appropriate. Our hands are not tied; I am ruling nothing out, as I have said. If our hands were tied in a certain direction, I would say at this stage that we had a sense that we were ruling out this or that. But I\\u2019m not saying that. I\\u2019m not committing myself to anything, and the fact that sister institutions are doing this or that does not mean that we should do the same. I have said, since the very beginning we have been in a very different situation. We also have to take into account the fact that the commercial banks are our main channel on this side of the Atlantic, by comparison with the other side of the Atlantic.\\nNow, let me say, in order to ensure that you don\\u2019t miss any information, that the next Governing Council meeting and press conference on 2 April will take place here, and not in Italy, as it had been envisaged at a certain point in time. So, I want to make it clear that the next meeting will be in Frankfurt. We will have the external meeting in Luxembourg on 2 July. You know that and it is published on the website. I just wanted to confirm that. And it is on 8 October that we will be in Italy.\\nCONTACT\\nEuropean Central Bank\\nDirectorate General Communications\\nSonnemannstrasse 20\\n60314 Frankfurt am Main, Germany\\n+49 69 1344 7455\\nmedia@ecb.europa.eu\\nReproduction is permitted provided that the source is acknowledged.\\nMedia contacts\",\n          \"Question:\\nThe first question I would really like to ask is about the future direction of the European Central Bank\\u2019s policy and I was wondering if you could tell us a bit more about how much accommodation the European Central Bank still sees left in its monetary policy and how much of that accommodation needs to be withdrawn to ensure price stability over the medium term?\\nTrichet:\\nOn this point I will be very clear. There is not an \\u201cex ante\\u201d decision of the Governing Council at today\\u2019s meeting to engage in a series of interest rate increases. We have decided to increase rates by 0.25 percentage point because we judged that, with this new level, we are in line with our duty, our mandate, which is to preserve price stability and to be credible over time in preserving price stability. It is our responsibility vis \\u00e1 vis the 311 million people in the euro area, our fellow citizens. It is our duty because it is what the Treaty is calling for. And it is the best way to anchor inflationary expectations. We will see, then, what the new information, the new facts and the new figures are that will permit the Governing Council to make a judgement and take new decisions. We are not engaging, ex ante, in a series of interest rate increases. And, as I have said, we will continue to monitor closely all developments with regard to risks to price stability.\\nQuestion:\\nTwo questions. I assume that the projections that you will release today do not incorporate today\\u2019s interest rate decision. And, if that is correct, if you re-ran the projections with a rate of 2.25%, would the 2007 inflation mid-point be lower than the 2% you have projected today? And the second question I have is: What do you make of all the political voices that you have been hearing, from finance ministers, for example, about your policy?\\nTrichet:\\nAs regards your first question to the extent that the short-term market rates had already anticipated our today\\u2019s move this move was incorporated in the Eurosystem staff projections.\\nAs regards the various voices that you mention, I will only say that we are fortunate to live in a lively set of democracies. We are fortunate to live in a European democracy which is itself lively. I myself, as you know, recently addressed the European Parliament. And I would mention,\\nen passant\\n, that I address the European Parliament as frequently as my colleague Alan Greenspan addresses the US parliament \\u201con the hill\\u201d. I have said, as clearly as possible, what we thought and what our own understanding of the situation was. We try to be as transparent and predictable as possible. We are not influenced \\u2013 as stated in the Treaty, which is very clear in that respect \\u2013 by any so-called \\u201cvoices\\u201d or recommendations. We have a duty not to be influenced \\u2013 in any respect. Not up or down. Because it was suggested we do this or that. Our colleagues, the Vice-President and myself, all members of the Governing Council know that we have a mandate \\u2013 a very clear mandate \\u2013 given by the Treaty. We know what the people of Europe are calling on us to do. We are responsible for price stability. 311 million people are expecting us to deliver price stability. And their message is very clear: they are asking us to live up to our mandate. That is the message of the 311 million people. And because we live up to our mandate, we can reinforce confidence in those 311 million people. And we also inspire confidence to investors and savers in Europe and the world in a way which allows us to deliver the lowest market rates that existed in the most credible part of Europe, from a monetary point of view, before the euro. Which is an incredible success. And let me mention,\\nen passant\\n, that the 2% rate that we have maintained for two and a half years while very solidly anchoring inflationary expectations was a level of interest rates lower than the lowest rate that the Bundesbank had ever set since its creation, since World War II. The Bundesbank itself had never set its discount rate at the level of 2%. We were lower than its lowest level. And not for 80 million Germans, but for 311 million people in Europe. And again, this level of market rates, this level of market interest rates over five years, ten years, thirty years and fifty years is duet to the confidence in our own Central Bank. Our own credibility. The credibility of the Governing Council of the ECB. Among those people who are looking at what we are doing and taking decisions on a day-by-day \\u2013 even a minute-by-minute \\u2013 basis, you have non-euro area residents holding approximately EUR 3.5 trillion in negotiable instruments and liquid deposits. Those people are making judgements on our credibility to deliver price stability over ten years, over thirty years and over fifty years. Because we are credible they give us low market interest rates favourable for growth and job creation. And that is the reason why we are faithful to our mandate.\\nQuestion:\\nCould we make a distinction between the long-term level of interest rates, which you have noted are historically low, and the effect of a price increase on the tentative recovery in Europe? If indeed, as you imply, there\\u2019s an accommodative overhang and you are correcting this, you are making this structural move, is this the right point in the cycle to be doing it when domestic demand in Europe is just coming out of a recovery? Would it not have been better to make such a structural correction when we are further into a cyclical recovery? You might note that this is the criticism made by the ECB Shadow Council, which includes a former head of the Monetary Policy Stance Division of the ECB. How would you respond to that observation?\\nTrichet:\\nIf I am not misled \\u2013 but perhaps I was reading things too rapidly \\u2013 they were divided: ten on one side and eight on the other side. So in this shadow group there are various views. Again, before the euro was set up nobody was predicting that we would be as credible as the most credible central banks. Every economist, every market participant, investors and savers were thinking that there would be a loss of credibility, which was after all understandable because we were going to merge highly credible currencies and currencies that were not at all as credible. So a kind of average of credibility and confidence was what the observers, economists, investors and savers were expecting. Because of our remarkable own credibility we could deliver this extraordinary low level of rates, which had been the privilege of only a part of Europe and not the privilege of 311 million people. Today we have judged unanimously that the increased level of risks to price stability embedded in the situation were such that today\\u2019s correction was necessary to fulfil our mandate and to maintain the full credibility that we have. I have to say that when you look at the figures extracted from the various bond markets \\u2013 it\\u2019s not literature that we are discussing its fact, figures, numbers, arithmetic \\u2013 when we said that we would moderately increase our rates, we gained in terms of credibility. We have gained in terms of forward break-even rates and we have proved that our own interaction with the European and global markets has led them to judge that we were right in doing what we have done. And in so doing, we will allow growth in Europe to be sustained and not short-lived. That is the conviction of the 18 members of the Governing Council.\\nQuestion:\\nMr President, you spoke of divisions on the ECB Shadow Council. Were there any divisions on the Governing Council?\\nTrichet:\\nI said that we were unanimous.\\nQuestion:\\nJust a follow-up on that last point: I think it would be helpful to lots of people if you could give us your account of how the debate has evolved within the Governing Council in recent weeks and months. You said the Council is unanimous on today\\u2019s decision, but did anyone propose not raising interest rates today? Did anyone raise the idea of increasing them by 50 basis points? In this connection, perhaps you could tell us a little about your level of vigilance going forward? We became very used to you saying \\u201cstrong vigilance, we can act any time\\u201d. That language has now disappeared. Is that because the 25 basis points mean you don\\u2019t have to say those things at this precise point in time? And if I may ask one other question on your profile for inflation, has inflation now peaked? When do you expect it to go back to below 2%?\\nTrichet:\\nFirst on the Governing Council sentiment. You might remember that we had indicated that we were in a mode of strong vigilance in Athens and I remember that all of you noted that the sentiment of the Governing Council was different in Athens in comparison with what it had been a month before. We judged that the risks to price stability were increasing, were on the upside, and I made that very clear in responding to questions. We confirmed the view that risks were on the upside and had augmented at the press conference and in the introductory remarks a month ago, and that was again noted by everybody. It was so clearly noted that it triggered a great number of voices \\u2013 that have already been mentioned \\u2013 commenting on interest rates. We have various views inside the Governing Council, as it is necessary. Collegial wisdom implies that you exchange all possible information, arguments and analyses. The pertinent entity which is the Governing Council relies very much on a collegial, very confident and very comprehensive exchanges of views. And there emerges from that exchange of views a majority sentiment which can from time to time be a unanimous sentiment. We unanimously decided today to do what I have already announced, and of course we had various views, which were exchanged. Some perhaps could have imagined that we would have gone higher, and others perhaps would have thought before the discussion that we could wait a little longer. But after the discussion those who wanted to go higher considered the move that I am commenting today to be correct, and the others thought that it was appropriate to join in and to take the decision I announced, which again has been taken unanimously. You had a series of questions on vigilance. I will only say again what I have said very clearly. We are not, ex ante, engaging in a series of interest rate increases. We will monitor all developments closely, as I have said, with respect to risks to price stability. And we will continue to do exactly what is necessary to deliver price stability and to be credible. We will maintain the confidence of households in price stability, and maintain the confidence of investors and savers over time. We will solidly anchor inflation expectations and preserve a yield curve which is exceptionally favourable for growth and job creation in Europe. All this relies on our European and global credibility.\\nQuestion:\\nTwo questions. First, in July 2003 after the Federal Reserve System had begun its tightening cycle, you went out of your way to emphasise the different conditions in Europe. \\u201cWe are in different universes\\u201d, you said at the time. Now that the Federal Reserve System has over a year of a tightening cycle behind it and is no longer, shall we say, the chief supplier of cheap money in the world as the ECB now is, I want to invite you to repeat this statement. Second, you have emphasised, as you have many other times, that you need to be as transparent and predictable as possible in your actions. A few weeks ago, you stood up at a banking conference in Frankfurt and dropped a strong hint that you would do today what you have indeed done. There are many banking conferences in Frankfurt; you will have many opportunities to do the same thing. Is there anything in today\\u2019s Governing Council statement that would prevent you from doing that?\\nTrichet:\\nI am not sure if I understand your question correctly.\\nQuestion:\\nIs there anything in this statement that would prevent you from making a similar statement as you did.\\nTrichet:\\nIf I understand the question correctly, certainly not! But allow me to mention two things: First, the Federal Reserve is responsible for price stability, which is a necessary condition for growth and job creation, as you will find out in the speeches of my colleague, Alain Greenspan. We share exactly the same sentiment: price stability is a necessary condition for growth, sustainable growth and sustainable job creation. Not per se, unfortunately, a sufficient condition, but a necessary condition. The Federal Reserve does what it has to do and we do what we have to do. The judges are the observers, households, market participants, investors and savers and the facts and figures I was mentioning. I recommend that you look at the figures. This morning I looked at the markets to check the differential between the US ten-year rate, for instance, and the Euro ten-year rate. I am not sure that the large public perceives that this differential is in the magnitude of 1%, a full 100 basis points.\\nSecond, as regards the banking conference in Frankfurt which took place approximately a fortnight ago, I did not stand up, I was there at the banking conference, I had been invited, I was on the spot, and the Chairman of the panel, Mr Walter, asked me \\u201ccould you tell us, Sir, what we need to know and to understand on interest rates and the monetary policy of the ECB\\u201d. It was a direct question, which I was asked when I was on the podium. I responded in what I trusted was necessary, namely to give those of you attending clarity and appropriate information and to give, through you, of course, market participants, observers, savers and public opinion the information that would be useful at that stage. We really trust that transparency is very important. At that time, there were so many voices speaking on interest rates, not inside the Governing Council but outside of it, that perhaps some of you might have had trouble understanding exactly what was happening, and I thought that it was appropriate to provide this information.\\nQuestion:\\nTwo questions: following up your previous answer, does that mean that you did not discuss the statement you made on November 18, 2005 with the other Governing Council members?\\nTrichet:\\nI will respond immediately: I said that I conveyed the sentiment of the Governing Council.\\nQuestion:\\nDo you expect core inflation to rise and does that not imply higher interest rates? And/or would you describe your position as being totally neutral on interest rates? Do you have any bias at the moment?\\nTrichet:\\nTwo very different questions. As you know, we do not follow core inflation. We follow headline inflation. And we are very clear as regards our monetary policy concept. We also say that it is extremely important to look to the medium term. In accordance with our mandate, we have to deliver price stability in the medium term, which means that we must understand what is transitory and what is permanent in the inflationary phenomenon. In the introductory remark, we mentioned the fact that, from time to time, we hear voices mentioning that core inflation \\u2013 that is, their definition of core inflation \\u2013 is the best predictor of future inflation. When you look at research, facts and figures, it is clear that it is much more complex. There are cases where core inflation is a good predictor. However, there are a lot of cases where core inflation is not a good predictor. This is because, contrary to what some are arguing \\u2013 that headline inflation will go down to join core inflation \\u2013 it is, in fact, the opposite that holds, that core inflation is going up to join headline inflation. It is therefore very misleading to trust that core inflation (of which there are various definitions) is always a good predictor. In any case, as you know, we look at all the information at our disposal, separating what we trust is transitory from what we trust is permanent. An additional remark we made was that there is now little doubt that a large part of what we are observing in the oil prices and in the commodity prices is a demand-driven process, that is, coming largely, but not exclusively, from emerging Asia and is also producing a lot of consequences in the manufacturing sector. And so some prices are pushed up, while others are pushed down. If you eliminate all those prices that are pushed up and maintain in your understanding of inflation those which are pushed down, perhaps it is not fair; perhaps it is better for demand-driven change in relative prices to look at the full picture and not only at part of the picture. This of course calls for additional research \\u2013 there is a lot of research on that. Probably, what I am telling you now is an emerging consensus amongst our own constituency of central banks.\\nQuestion:\\nIt is a big day for all of us. We have been waiting for a move for months, if not years. How are you feeling today? You must be nervous. Can you tell us a bit about it? It\\u2019s important. And also, could you give us a bit of a sense of how the debate was within the Governing Council? I understand it was a unanimous decision, but was it a vivid debate? What were your feelings on the debate? And one last question regarding the so-called voices: your predecessor used to say \\u201cI hear, but I do not listen\\u201d. Would you say the same?\\nTrichet:\\nFirst of all, I feel the responsibility of being the President of a college that must deliver price stability: a college that is called by a Treaty, and by 311 million people, to deliver price stability; and a college that has so far succeeded in achieving the highest level of credibility vis-\\u00e0-vis Europe and the rest of the world, as far as market participants, investors and savers are concerned.\\nAs regards my own feelings, they are feelings of responsibility and also that of a very strong team spirit. The 18 members of the Governing Council are a great team. And seen from the rest of the world and from Europe, that team is credible. And I can prove it. Who would have thought that I could stand here in front of you and tell you that over the past five years we have had the same level of medium and long-term market rates \\u2013 not to speak of the short-term rates (we are lower as regards the short-term rates) \\u2013 as the best and most credible currencies.\\nThe debate today was profound, deep and highly responsible. We discussed all possible arguments and exchanged views to be sure that we were taking the best decision. And that is our intimate conviction.\\nQuestion:\\nI have two questions. What is the level of potential growth in Europe? This is very unclear, because last time some people thought it was 1.5%, and second, I have the impression that your strategy, as far as announcing interest rate change is concerned, has changed to become somewhat clearer and more predictable. It has never happened before that the President of the ECB has said what the Bank will do 15 days before a Governing Council meeting, or 15 days after a Council meeting where no rate move has been made. And you were reading from a speaking note; it was not just coming out of your heart. It has also never happened before that a board member has said a day before the Council meeting that it was highly probable that a move would come, as Mr Bini Smaghi said yesterday. So, is this a change of strategy or is it wanted?\\nTrichet:\\nFirst on the growth potential. We ourselves are not dictating what is the growth potential of Europe. All economists, all international institutions and national institutions are looking at it. And I will refer to what seems to me to be some kind of emerging consensus. When I take the analysis of the OECD, the IMF, the Commission, our own analysis, the private-sector analysis and so forth, I would say, as regards the medium and long-term growth potential, that the previous appreciation was that it was between 2% and 2.5%, and now there is probably a sentiment \\u2013 again, I am cautious as you see \\u2013 that we are closer to 2%: 2% plus something which is meagre, 2.1%, 2.2% perhaps; but closer to 2% than 2.5%. On a shorter-term basis, namely for next year for instance, there is also quite a large sentiment \\u2013 but, again, I am very cautious \\u2013 that perhaps we are just below 2%. 1.5% is not a figure which, to my knowledge, is applicable to the short term or medium term. It would apply rather to the much longer term \\u2013 20 or 25 years \\u2013 taking into account very poor evolution of demography and perhaps also the very negative working assumption that structural reforms are not being done. I consider it not credible because it accumulates a number of negative factors that I trust will be corrected.\\nOn predictability, we were very proud to be one of the most predictable central banks of the world, perhaps I could say \\u201cex aequo\\u201d with a great sister institution \\u2013 perhaps the most predictable \\u2013 and we will continue to be highly predictable.\\nQuestion:\\n\\u2026 but is this an increase in predictability \\u2026\\nTrichet:\\n\\u2026 no, I am not sure it is an increase in predictability It is an implementation of predictability.\\nQuestion:\\nI have a question on another topic. You have just changed the rules for collateral. A-minus and better-rated government bonds will be accepted in repos. Why have you shifted so much power to the private agencies? This is my first question. And the second is: are you not concerned that this would dilute the importance of democratic decisions of elected parliaments and governments if you gave the agencies power to decide over our budgets?\\nTrichet:\\nFirst of all, it is not a new decision. It is a decision that was implemented when the euro was first introduced. And the market people \\u2013 the specialists observing what we were doing, looking at our website \\u2013 could see that there was no change. It was what we had done since the very beginning; it was embedded in our policy. It has been made more visible, but there has been no change. We are bound to treat private paper and public paper in the same fashion. And the A-minus threshold that you mentioned, again, is something which has been state of the art since the very beginning. We were told very often by parts of the economists\\u2019 community and by a lot of good advisors that we were \\u2013 and this was exactly the contrary observation \\u2013 too benign, too positive vis-\\u00e0-vis government paper, that we should practice a lot of haircuts and so forth, or practice haircuts combined with the Stability and Growth Pact implementation \\u2013 or non-implementation. We thought that this was not appropriate. We said that it was not appropriate for us to invent a new sanction that would apply for non-compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact via this collateral mechanism. We felt that we should not do that. But we mentioned also very clearly to market people that we were taking the paper at its market value, so that if the markets would assess that the paper was less credible and the spreads would augment, then the value of the paper that we would take as collateral would diminish. And then we were sticking to this appreciation by the market itself.\\nQuestion:\\nGiven your remarks today as well as your remarks last week before the European Parliament about the ECB not having any catching up to do, I am wondering if you could clarify something for us a little: are we supposed to see today\\u2019s move as a one-off measure for now or is it part of a broader policy shift towards a gradual removal of accommodation for the economy?\\nTrichet:\\nI thought I had been clear, but this is an occasion to be clear again. We have not taken any ex ante decision to embark on a series of interest rate increases. We will look at the facts and figures, make our judgement on the risks to price stability and take the decisions we will judge appropriate to deliver price stability.\\nQuestion:\\nFor this question I would like to have a comment from Mr Papademos as well, if possible. In any case I would like to ask if you think your decision today would have a specific impact on the weaker economies of the European Union, especially in terms of their ability to cope with the Lisbon strategy?\\nPapademos:\\nWe do not expect that a change in the monetary policy stance is going to have a significant effect on economic activity in the euro area as a whole. And then the extent to which there would be a specific impact in a given country depends on a variety of other factors that influence economic activity in that country as well.\\nTrichet:\\nAs Lucas said, we look at the 311 million people and we cannot do otherwise. It would be exactly as if you would ask our friends in the US whether they are taking into account the position of Texas, of California, and so on. You see, we have a single monetary area, a single euro, and we have to make an overall judgement. And I mentioned in the introductory remarks that Lucas and I and all our colleagues were pleased, I have to say, with some of the measures that have been taken on the structural side,\\nQuestion:\\nJust two small questions. One is: You characterised a 2% interest rate as historically low. Maybe you have never used the word \\u201crecord\\u201d low, but the lowest since the establishment of the Bundesbank. What words would you use to characterise a 2.25% interest rate? That is the first question. And then the second question is: for those of us who are rusty on our Latin, we all getting to know the phrase \\u201cex ante\\u201d and I just wanted to ask you \\u2013 because I think it is not a trivial point \\u2013 when you say an \\u201cex ante decision\\u201d, what precisely do you mean by that?\\nTrichet:\\nEx ante means \\u201cex ante\\u201d in English and in Latin. In French, I would say \\u201ca priori\\u201d and not \\u201cex ante\\u201d, but only in French. In English it would be \\u2013 it seems to me \\u2013 \\u201cex ante\\u201d.\\n2% is not the lowest, it is lower than the lowest figure attained by the Bundesbank. It is perfectly possible that 2.25 has the same characteristics!\\nQuestion:\\nMr President, if I am not mistaken, the rate of contractual wage increases in the last available quarter was 2.1%. Now some economists think this is unhealthily low. You seem to be in a spirit that you would be alarmed if it was going higher. Could you give us an idea what would be a rate, or a range of rates, of wage increases that you would think in line with price stability?\\nTrichet:\\nNo, I will not. But I will tell you \\u2013 because you are offering me the possibility of making the point \\u2013 that what we do is to cope with the risks we see. From time to time, I am told that these risks do not actually materialise. And then it is added that one should wait for the materialisation of these risks. But if a risk materialises, it is no longer a risk! It has become the figure you have in front of you, and that would be too late. So, here we are doing something that we consider to be exactly appropriate to cope with those risks and to avoid a materialisation of those risks. And this is the understanding of the global market. The global markets have understood this, if you look at the range of market information we are receiving, particularly from the bonds market, whether indexed or not.\\nQuestion:\\nMr President, could you give us an idea of what percentage the effect of the German VAT increase contributed to your inflation forecast for 2007 and \\u2013 a second question, if I may \\u2013 could you give us an idea of where you see a neutral rate, even if you are saying now that there is not ex ante decision to approach it, but which range could we think of?\\nTrichet:\\nI will certainly not give you a neutral rate figure. It was not done on the other side of the Atlantic either. I do not myself refer to a neutral rate. I refer to the rate which is in line with what allows us to deliver price stability and to be credible in the delivery of price stability over time. As regards your first question, I will only mention that, at the level of the staff \\u2013 and do not forget it is the staff of the Eurosystem who prepared the projections \\u2013 we have taken all information into consideration, including the information that was available in Germany, of course, but not only that on Germany, all the information available in all of the 12 economies that make up the euro area.\\nQuestion:\\nMr President, I have a question on your dialogue with Eurogroup Finance Minister Juncker. At the next G7 Meeting you have to speak with one voice because foreign exchange rate policy is a divided matter that belongs to you and the ECOFIN President, Eurogroup President. What is your dialogue today to find one voice after the monetary recommendations of Jean-Claude Juncker over the last days?\\nTrichet:\\nAs regards monetary policy, Jean-Claude Juncker himself said it very clearly in front of the Parliament: It is our decision. It is the decision of this institution and there is no dispute on the fact that it is our decision. So, where monetary policy is at stake, there is absolutely no ambiguity. As regards the dialogue with Jean-Claude Juncker in preparation of the G7, we have never had any problem of that kind in the past, and I do not expect any such problem in the future. You know that we will be having discussions with our other friends, with members of the G7 on exchange rates. In that respect, we had in the last G7 meetings a very clear sentiment that I have signed up to myself and that was endorsed by all members, including Jean-Claude Juncker and his predecessor. And I expect that we will reach a consensus in exactly the same fashion, a consensus that will not only be a consensus amongst Europeans \\u2013 because that would obviously not be very efficient \\u2013 but a consensus with the United States, with Japan and with the other friends \\u2013 the United Kingdom and Canada \\u2013 and that we will together sign what we trust and judge to be appropriate. You will see what we will say in London, and I will of course not reveal in advance what we will say.\\nQuestion:\\nMr Trichet, just two short questions. Suddenly, a fortnight ago, we as observers were surprised by a statement in front of the banking congress. Were some members of the Governing Council surprised as well by that statement? And the second question refers to the communication in front of the first press conference in November and the press conference today: historically, you had this idea that the week before the meetings no one on the Governing Council would speak to the public about monetary policy and, suddenly, that was broken in November as well as in December. Are you going to stop that or do we have to live in a new universe of communication?\\nTrichet:\\nIt is absolutely clear that we have a purdah period and that if there has been such communication; it was not in line with our concept. I have no memory of anything in November, but then it was because one person did not realise that there were journalists in the room. But it is not the intention of any member of the Governing Council not to respect the purdah period, that is absolutely clear and it is important. It is a rule which is also state of the art in the constituency of central banks.\\nAs regards your first question, no members of the Governing Council were surprised by what I said because I expressed the sentiment of the Governing Council.\\nCONTACT\\nEuropean Central Bank\\nDirectorate General Communications\\nSonnemannstrasse 20\\n60314 Frankfurt am Main, Germany\\n+49 69 1344 7455\\nmedia@ecb.europa.eu\\nReproduction is permitted provided that the source is acknowledged.\\nMedia contacts\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"1999-01-07 00:00:00\",\n        \"max\": \"2025-12-18 00:00:00\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 274,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2001-07-05 00:00:00\",\n          \"2013-02-07 00:00:00\",\n          \"2015-12-03 00:00:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":59}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Build bigram sets\n","if \"bigrams_statement\" not in df.columns:\n","    df[\"bigrams_statement\"] = df[\"statement_text_clean\"].apply(bigram_set)\n","\n","if \"bigrams_qa\" not in df.columns:\n","    df[\"bigrams_qa\"] = df[\"qa_text_clean\"].apply(bigram_set)\n","\n","df[[\"date\", \"bigrams_statement\", \"bigrams_qa\"]].head(2)\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":112},"id":"OlR7YP27NneJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1767020949628,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":11564,"user":{"displayName":"Katarzyna Pastuszka","userId":"07834223025530373828"}},"outputId":"ea4e3894-6eeb-422f-ca65-0703149e0c7f"},"execution_count":61,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["        date                                  bigrams_statement  \\\n","0 1999-01-07  {(conduct, variabl), (real, gdp), (area, money...   \n","1 1999-02-04  {(facil, continu), (continu, favour), (real, g...   \n","\n","                                          bigrams_qa  \n","0  {(flat, countri), (us, exchang), (rate, cours)...  \n","1  {(global, economi), (context, ecb), (well, las...
